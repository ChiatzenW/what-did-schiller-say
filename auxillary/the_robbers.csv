ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,1,Apartment in the Castle of COUNT MOOR.
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,2,"FRANCIS, OLD MOOR."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,3,"FRANCIS. But are you really well, father? You look so pale."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,4,"OLD MOOR. Quite well, my son�what have you to tell me?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,5,"FRANCIS. The post is arrived�a letter from our correspondent at
      Leipsic."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,6,OLD M. (eagerly). Any tidings of my son Charles?
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,7,"FRANCIS. Hem! Hem!�Why, yes. But I fear�I know not�whether
      I dare �your health.�Are you really quite well, father?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,8,"OLD M. As a fish in water.* Does he write of my son? What means this
      anxiety about my health? You have asked me that question twice."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,9,"[*This is equivalent to our English saying ""As sound as a roach.""]"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,10,"FRANCIS. If you are unwell�or are the least apprehensive of being so�
      permit me to defer�I will speak to you at a fitter season.�(Half
      aside.) These are no tidings for a feeble frame."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,11,OLD M. Gracious Heavens? what am I doomed to hear?
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,12,"FRANCIS. First let me retire and shed a tear of compassion for my lost
      brother. Would that my lips might be forever sealed�for he is your
      son! Would that I could throw an eternal veil over his shame�for he
      is my brother! But to obey you is my first, though painful, duty�forgive
      me, therefore."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,13,"OLD M. Oh, Charles! Charles! Didst thou but know what thorns thou plantest
      in thy father's bosom! That one gladdening report of thee would add ten
      years to my life! yes, bring back my youth! whilst now, alas, each fresh
      intelligence but hurries me a step nearer to the grave!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,14,"FRANCIS. Is it so, old man, then farewell! for even this very day we might
      all have to tear our hair over your coffin.*"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,15,"[* This idiom is very common in Germany, and is used to express
   affliction.]"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,16,"OLD M. Stay! There remains but one short step more�let him have his
      will! (He sits down.) The sins of the father shall be visited unto the
      third and fourth generation�let him fulfil the decree."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,17,"FRANCIS (takes the letter out of his pocket). You know our correspondent!
      See! I would give a finger of my right hand might I pronounce him a liar�a
      base and slanderous liar! Compose yourself! Forgive me if I do not let you
      read the letter yourself. You cannot, must not, yet know all."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,18,"OLD M. All, all, my son. You will but spare me crutches.*"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,19,"[* Du ersparst mir die Krucke; meaning that the contents of the
   letter can but shorten his declining years, and so spare him the
   necessity of crutches.]"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,20,"FRANCIS (reads). ""Leipsic, May 1. Were I not bound by an inviolable
      promise to conceal nothing from you, not even the smallest particular,
      that I am able to collect, respecting your brother's career, never, my
      dearest friend, should my guiltless pen become an instrument of torture to
      you. I can gather from a hundred of your letters how tidings such as these
      must pierce your fraternal heart. It seems to me as though I saw thee, for
      the sake of this worthless, this detestable""�(OLD M. covers his
      face). Oh! my father, I am only reading you the mildest passages�
      ""this detestable man, shedding a thousand tears."" Alas! mine flowed�ay,
      gushed in torrents over these pitying cheeks. ""I already picture to myself
      your aged pious father, pale as death."" Good Heavens! and so you are,
      before you have heard anything."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,21,OLD M. Go on! Go on!
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,22,"FRANCIS. ""Pale as death, sinking down on his chair, and cursing the day
      when his ear was first greeted with the lisping cry of 'Father!' I have
      not yet been able to discover all, and of the little I do know I dare tell
      you only a part. Your brother now seems to have filled up the measure of
      his infamy. I, at least, can imagine nothing beyond what he has already
      accomplished; but possibly his genius may soar above my conceptions. After
      having contracted debts to the amount of forty thousand ducats,""�a
      good round sum for pocket-money, father--""and having dishonored the
      daughter of a rich banker, whose affianced lover, a gallant youth of rank,
      he mortally wounded in a duel, he yesterday, in the dead of night, took
      the desperate resolution of absconding from the arm of justice, with seven
      companions whom he had corrupted to his own vicious courses."" Father? for
      heaven's sake, father! How do you feel?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,23,"OLD M. Enough. No more, my son, no more!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,24,"FRANCIS. I will spare your feelings. ""The injured cry aloud for
      satisfaction. Warrants have been issued for his apprehension�a price
      is set on his head�the name of Moor""�No, these unhappy lips
      shall not be guilty of a father's murder (he tears the letter). Believe it
      not, my father, believe not a syllable."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,25,OLD M. (weeps bitterly). My name�my unsullied name!
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,26,"FRANCIS (throws himself on his neck). Infamous! most infamous Charles! Oh,
      had I not my forebodings, when, even as a boy, he would scamper after the
      girls, and ramble about over hill and common with ragamuffin boys and all
      the vilest rabble; when he shunned the very sight of a church as a
      malefactor shuns a gaol, and would throw the pence he had wrung from your
      bounty into the hat of the first beggar he met, whilst we at home were
      edifying ourselves with devout prayers and pious homilies? Had I not my
      misgivings when he gave himself up to reading the adventures of Julius
      Caesar, Alexander the Great, and other benighted heathens, in preference
      to the history of the penitent Tobias? A hundred times over have I warned
      you�for my brotherly affection was ever kept in subjection to filial
      duty�that this forward youth would one day bring sorrow and disgrace
      on us all. Oh that he bore not the name of Moor! that my heart beat less
      warmly for him! This sinful affection, which I can not overcome, will one
      day rise up against me before the judgment-seat of heaven."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,27,OLD M. Oh! my prospects! my golden dreams!
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,28,"FRANCIS. Ay, well I knew it. Exactly what I always feared. That fiery
      spirit, you used to say, which is kindling in the boy, and renders him so
      susceptible to impressions of the beautiful and grand�the
      ingenuousness which reveals his whole soul in his eyes�the
      tenderness of feeling which melts him into weeping sympathy at every tale
      of sorrow�the manly courage which impels him to the summit of giant
      oaks, and urges him over fosse and palisade and foaming torrents�that
      youthful thirst of honor�that unconquerable resolution�all
      those resplendent virtues which in the father's darling gave such promise�
      would ripen into the warm and sincere friend�the excellent citizen�the
      hero�the great, the very great man! Now, mark the result, father;
      the fiery spirit has developed itself�expanded�and behold its
      precious fruits. Observe this ingenuousness�how nicely it has
      changed into effrontery;�this tenderness of soul�how it
      displays itself in dalliance with coquettes, in susceptibility to the
      blandishments of a courtesan! See this fiery genius, how in six short
      years it hath burnt out the oil of life, and reduced his body to a living
      skeleton; so that passing scoffers point at him with a sneer and exclaim�""C'est
      l'amour qui a fait cela."" Behold this bold, enterprising spirit�how
      it conceives and executes plans, compared to which the deeds of a
      Cartouche or a Howard sink into insignificance. And presently, when these
      precious germs of excellence shall ripen into full maturity, what may not
      be expected from the full development of such a boyhood? Perhaps, father,
      you may yet live to see him at the head of some gallant band, which
      assembles in the silent sanctuary of the forest, and kindly relieves the
      weary traveller of his superfluous burden. Perhaps you may yet have the
      opportunity, before you go to your own tomb, of making a pilgrimage to the
      monument which he may erect for himself, somewhere between earth and
      heaven! Perhaps,�oh, father�father, look out for some other
      name, or the very peddlers and street boys who have seen the effigy of
      your worthy son exhibited in the market-place at Leipsic will point at you
      with the finger of scorn!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,29,"OLD M. And thou, too, my Francis, thou too? Oh, my children, how
      unerringly your shafts are levelled at my heart."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,30,"FRANCIS. You see that I too have a spirit; but my spirit bears the sting
      of a scorpion. And then it was ""the dry commonplace, the cold, the wooden
      Francis,"" and all the pretty little epithets which the contrast between us
      suggested to your fatherly affection, when he was sitting on your knee, or
      playfully patting your cheeks? ""He would die, forsooth, within the
      boundaries of his own domain, moulder away, and soon be forgotten;"" while
      the fame of this universal genius would spread from pole to pole! Ah! the
      cold, dull, wooden Francis thanks thee, heaven, with uplifted hands, that
      he bears no resemblance to his brother."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,31,"OLD M. Forgive me, my child! Reproach not thy unhappy father, whose
      fondest hopes have proved visionary. The merciful God who, through
      Charles, has sent these tears, will, through thee, my Francis, wipe them
      from my eyes!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,32,"FRANCIS. Yes, father, we will wipe them from your eyes. Your Francis will
      devote�his life to prolong yours. (Taking his hand with affected
      tenderness.) Your life is the oracle which I will especially consult on
      every undertaking�the mirror in which I will contemplate everything.
      No duty so sacred but I am ready to violate it for the preservation of
      your precious days. You believe me?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,33,"OLD M. Great are the duties which devolve on thee, my son�Heaven
      bless thee for what thou has been, and wilt be to me."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,34,"FRANCIS. Now tell me frankly, father. Should you not be a happy man, were
      you not obliged to call this son your own?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,35,"OLD M. In mercy, spare me! When the nurse first placed him in my arms, I
      held him up to Heaven and exclaimed, ""Am I not truly blest?"""
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,36,"FRANCIS. So you said then. Now, have you found it so? You may envy the
      meanest peasant on your estate in this, that he is not the father of such
      a son. So long as you call him yours you are wretched. Your misery will
      grow with his years�it will lay you in your grave."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,37,OLD M. Oh! he has already reduced me to the decrepitude of fourscore.
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,38,"FRANCIS. Well, then�suppose you were to disown this son."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,39,OLD M. (startled). Francis! Francis! what hast thou said!
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,40,"FRANCIS. Is not your love for him the source of all your grief? Root out
      this love, and he concerns you no longer. But for this weak and
      reprehensible affection he would be dead to you;�as though he had
      never been born. It is not flesh and blood, it is the heart that makes us
      sons and fathers! Love him no more, and this monster ceases to be your
      son, though he were cut out of your flesh. He has till now been the apple
      of your eye; but if thine eye offend you, says Scripture, pluck it out. It
      is better to enter heaven with one eye than hell with two! ""It is
      profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that
      thy whole body should be cast into hell."" These are the words of the
      Bible!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,41,OLD M. Wouldst thou have me curse my son?
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,42,"FRANCIS. By no means, father. God forbid! But whom do you call your son?
      Him to whom you have given life, and who in return does his utmost to
      shorten yours."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,43,"OLD M. Oh, it is all too true! it is a judgment upon me. The Lord has
      chosen him as his instrument."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,44,"FRANCIS. See how filially your bosom child behaves. He destroys you by
      your own excess of paternal sympathy; murders you by means of the very
      love you bear him�has coiled round a father's heart to crush it.
      When you are laid beneath the turf he becomes lord of your possessions,
      and master of his own will. That barrier removed, and the torrent of his
      profligacy will rush on without control. Imagine yourself in his place.
      How often he must wish his father under ground�and how often, too,
      his brother�who so unmercifully impede the free course of his
      excesses. But call you this a requital of love? Is this filial gratitude
      for a father's tenderness? to sacrifice ten years of your life to the lewd
      pleasures of an hour? in one voluptuous moment to stake the honor of an
      ancestry which has stood unspotted through seven centuries? Do you call
      this a son? Answer? Do you call this your son?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,45,OLD M. An undutiful son! Alas! but still my child! my child!
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,46,"FRANCIS. A most amiable and precious child�whose constant study is
      to get rid of his father. Oh, that you could learn to see clearly! that
      the film might be removed from your eyes! But your indulgence must confirm
      him in his vices! your assistance tend to justify them. Doubtless you will
      avert the curse of Heaven from his head, but on your own, father�on
      yours�will it fall with twofold vengeance."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,47,"OLD M. Just! most just! Mine, mine be all the guilt!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,48,"FRANCIS. How many thousands who have drained the voluptuous bowl of
      pleasure to the dregs have been reclaimed by suffering! And is not the
      bodily pain which follows every excess a manifest declaration of the
      divine will! And shall man dare to thwart this by an impious exercise of
      affection? Shall a father ruin forever the pledge committed to his charge?
      Consider, father, if you abandon him for a time to the pressure of want
      will not he be obliged to turn from his wickedness and repent? Otherwise,
      untaught even in the great school of adversity, he must remain a confirmed
      reprobate? And then�woe to the father who by a culpable tenderness
      bath frustrated the ordinances of a higher wisdom! Well, father?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,49,OLD M. I will write to him that I withdraw my protection.
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,50,FRANCIS. That would be wise and prudent.
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,51,OLD M. That he must never come into my sight again
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,52,FRANCIS. 'Twill have a most salutary effect.
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,53,OLD M. (tenderly). Until he reforms.
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,54,"FRANCIS. Right, quite right. But suppose that he comes disguised in the
      hypocrite's mask, implores your compassion with tears, and wheedles from
      you a pardon, then quits you again on the morrow, and jests at your
      weakness in the arms of his harlot. No, my father! He will return of his
      own accord, when his conscience awakens him to repentance."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,55,"OLD M. I will write to him, on the spot, to that effect."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,56,"FRANCIS. Stop, father, one word more. Your just indignation might prompt
      reproaches too severe, words which might break his heart�and then�do
      you not think that your deigning to write with your own hand might be
      construed into an act of forgiveness? It would be better, I think, that
      you should commit the task to me?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,57,"OLD M. Do it, my son. Ah! it would, indeed, have broken my heart! Write to
      him that�"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,58,"FRANCIS (quickly). That's agreed, then?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,59,"OLD M. Say that he has caused me a thousand bitter tears�a thousand
      sleepless nights�but, oh! do not drive my son to despair!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,60,"FRANCIS. Had you not better retire to rest, father? This affects you too
      strongly."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,61,"OLD M. Write to him that a father's heart�But I charge you, drive
      him not to despair. [Exit in sadness.]"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,62,"FRANCIS (looking after him with a chuckle). Make thyself easy, old dotard!
      thou wilt never more press thy darling to thy bosom�there is a gulf
      between thee and him impassable as heaven is from hell. He was torn from
      thy arms before even thou couldst have dreamed it possible to decree the
      separation. Why, what a sorry bungler should I be had I not skill enough
      to pluck a son from a father's heart; ay, though he were riveted there
      with hooks of steel! I have drawn around thee a magic circle of curses
      which he cannot overleap. Good speed to thee, Master Francis. Papa's
      darling is disposed of�the course is clear. I must carefully pick up
      all the scraps of paper, for how easily might my handwriting be
      recognized. (He gathers the fragments of the letter.) And grief will soon
      make an end of the old gentleman. And as for her� I must tear this
      Charles from her heart, though half her life come with him."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,63,"No small cause have I for being dissatisfied with Dame Nature, and, by my
      honor, I will have amends! Why did I not crawl the first from my mother's
      womb? why not the only one? why has she heaped on me this burden of
      deformity? on me especially? Just as if she had spawned me from her
      refuse.* Why to me in particular this snub of the Laplander? these negro
      lips? these Hottentot eyes? On my word, the lady seems to have collected
      from all the race of mankind whatever was loathsome into a heap, and
      kneaded the mass into my particular person. Death and destruction! who
      empowered her to deny to me what she accorded to him? Could a man pay his
      court to her before he was born? or offend her before he existed? Why went
      she to work in such a partial spirit?"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,64,"No! no! I do her injustice�she bestowed inventive faculty, and set
      us naked and helpless on the shore of this great ocean, the world�let
      those swim who can�the heavy** may sink. To me she gave naught else,
      and how to make the best use of my endowment is my present business. Men's
      natural rights are equal; claim is met by claim, effort by effort, and
      force by force�right is with the strongest�the limits of our
      power constitute our laws."
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,65,"It is true there are certain organized conventions, which men have devised
      to keep up what is called the social compact. Honor! truly a very
      convenient coin, which those who know how to pass it may lay out with
      great advantage.*** Conscience! oh yes, a useful scarecrow to frighten
      sparrows away from cherry-trees; it is something like a fairly written
      bill of exchange with which your bankrupt merchant staves off the evil
      day."

   scutcheon."""
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,67,"Well! these are all most admirable institutions for keeping fools in awe,
      and holding the mob underfoot, that the cunning may live the more at their
      ease. Rare institutions, doubtless. They are something like the fences my
      boors plant so closely to keep out the hares�yes I' faith, not a
      hare can trespass on the enclosure, but my lord claps spurs to his hunter,
      and away he gallops over the teeming harvest!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,68,"Poor hare! thou playest but a sorry part in this world's drama, but your
      worshipful lords must needs have hares!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,69,"*[This may help to illustrate a passage in Shakespeare which
   puzzles the commentators�""Cupid is a good hare-finder.""�Much ADO,

   The hare, in Germany, is considered an emblem of abject submission
   and cowardice. The word may also be rendered ""Simpleton,""
   ""Sawney,"" or any other of the numerous epithets which imply a soft
   condition.]"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,70,"Then courage, and onward, Francis. The man who fears nothing is as
      powerful as he who is feared by everybody. It is now the mode to wear
      buckles on your smallclothes, that you may loosen or tighten them at
      pleasure. I will be measured for a conscience after the newest fashion,
      one that will stretch handsomely as occasion may require. Am I to blame?
      It is the tailor's affair? I have heard a great deal of twaddle about the
      so-called ties of blood�enough to make a sober man beside himself.
      He is your brother, they say; which interpreted, means that he was
      manufactured in the same mould, and for that reason he must needs be
      sacred in your eyes! To what absurd conclusions must this notion of a
      sympathy of souls, derived from the propinquity of bodies, inevitably
      tend? A common source of being is to produce community of sentiment;
      identity of matter, identity of impulse! Then again,�he is thy
      father! He gave thee life, thou art his flesh and blood�and
      therefore he must be sacred to thee! Again a most inconsequential
      deduction! I should like to know why he begot me;** certainly not out of
      love for me�for I must first have existed!"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,71,"**[The reader of Sterne will remember a very similar passage in the
   first chapter of Tristram Shandy.]"
ACT I.,SCENE I.�Franconia.,72,"Could he know me before I had being, or did he think of me during my
      begetting? or did he wish for me at the moment? Did he know what I should
      be? If so I would not advise him to acknowledge it or I should pay him off
      for his feat. Am I to be thankful to him that I am a man? As little as I
      should have had a right to blame him if he had made me a woman. Can I
      acknowledge an affection which is not based on any personal regard? Could
      personal regard be present before the existence of its object? In what,
      then, consists the sacredness of paternity? Is it in the act itself out of
      which existence arose? as though this were aught else than an animal
      process to appease animal desires. Or does it lie, perhaps, in the result
      of this act, which is nothing more after all than one of iron necessity,
      and which men would gladly dispense with, were it not at the cost of flesh
      and blood? Do I then owe him thanks for his affection? Why, what is it but
      a piece of vanity, the besetting sin of the artist who admires his own
      works, however hideous they may be? Look you, this is the whole juggle,
      wrapped up in a mystic veil to work on our fears. And shall I, too, be
      fooled like an infant? Up then! and to thy work manfully. I will root up
      from my path whatever obstructs my progress towards becoming the master.
      Master I must be, that I may extort by force what I cannot win by
      affection.*"

      shot off, and you, by way of revenge, proclaimed a fast through the whole

      ordered all the meat to be bought up in Leipsic, so that in the course of
      eight hours there was not a bone left to pick all over the place, and even
      fish began to rise in price. The magistrates and the town council vowed
      vengeance. But we students turned out lustily, seventeen hundred of us,
      with you at our head, and butchers and tailors and haberdashers at our
      backs, besides publicans, barbers, and rabble of all sorts, swearing that
      the town should be sacked if a single hair of a student's head was
      injured. And so the affair went off like the shooting at Hornberg,* and

      the doctors got to fisticuffs for the three ducats, and their competition
      brought down the price to three groats; in the course of an hour a dozen

      thousand of us, a lantern in one hand and our rapier in the other, and so
      proceeded through the town, the bells chiming and ringing, till the dog
      was entombed. Then came a feed which lasted till broad daylight, when you
      sent your acknowledgments to the college dons for their kind sympathy, and
      ordered the meat to be sold at half-price. Mort de ma vie, if we

      You are not in earnest! Tell me! most sweet brother, is it not poverty
      which has brought you to this mood? Come! let me tell you a little story
      of my youthful days. There was a ditch close to my house, eight feet wide
      at the least, which we boys were trying to leap over for a wager. But it
      was no go. Splash! there you lay sprawling, amidst hisses and roars of
      laughter, and a relentless shower of snowballs. By the side of my house a
      hunter's dog was lying chained, a savage beast, which would catch the
      girls by their petticoats with the quickness of lightning if they
      incautiously passed too near him. Now it was my greatest delight to tease
      this brute in every possible way; and it was enough to make one burst with
      laughing to see the beast fix his eyes on me with such fierceness that he
      seemed ready to tear me to pieces if he could but get at me. Well, what
      happened? Once, when I was amusing myself in this manner, I hit him such a
      bang in the ribs with a stone that in his fury he broke loose and ran
      right upon me. I tore away like lightning, but�devil take it!�that
      confounded ditch lay right in my way. What was to be done? The dog was
      close at my heels and quite furious; there was no time to deliberate. I
      took a spring and cleared the ditch. To that leap I was indebted for life
      and limb; the beast would have torn me to atoms."
ACT I.,SCENE II.�A Tavern on the Frontier of Saxony.,28,CHARLES VON M. And to what does all this tend?
ACT I.,SCENE II.�A Tavern on the Frontier of Saxony.,29,"SPIEGEL. To this�that you may be taught that strength grows with the
      occasion. For which reason I never despair even when things are the worst.
      Courage grows with danger. Powers of resistance increase by pressure. It
      is evident by the obstacles she strews in my path that fate must have
      designed me for a great man."
ACT I.,SCENE II.�A Tavern on the Frontier of Saxony.,30,"CHARLES VON M. (angrily). I am not aware of anything for which we still
      require courage, and have not already shown it."
ACT I.,SCENE II.�A Tavern on the Frontier of Saxony.,31,"SPIEGEL. Indeed! And so you mean to let your gifts go to waste? To bury
      your talent? Do you think your paltry achievements at Leipsic amount to
      the ne plus ultra of genius? Let us but once get to the great world�Paris
      and London! where you get your ears boxed if you salute a man as honest.
      It is a real jubilee to practise one's handicraft there on a grand scale.

      was not bred to medicine, he would have discovered the elixir vitae.

      pitiful alms by singing doleful ditties under people's windows? Or will

pomp, the triumphs of the rich and great! Into the dust with thee,

      nothing more. And yet I would rather not do it myself, on account of what
      the world would say. I should not wish him to be killed, but merely
      disposed of. I should like to do what your clever physician does, only the
      reverse way�not stop Nature's course by running a bar across her
      path, but only help her to speed a little faster. Are we not able to
      prolong the conditions of life? Why, then, should we not also be able to
      shorten them? Philosophers and physiologists teach us how close is the
      sympathy between the emotions of the mind and the movements of the bodily
      machine. Convulsive sensations are always accompanied by a disturbance of
      the mechanical vibrations� passions injure the vital powers�an

      the citadel of life?�to work the body's destruction through the mind�ha!
      an original device!�who can accomplish this?�a device without
      a parallel! Think upon it, Moor! That were an art worthy of thee for its
      inventor. Has not poisoning been raised almost to the rank of a regular
      science, and Nature compelled, by the force of experiments, to define her
      limits, so that one may now calculate the heart's throbbings for years in
      advance, and say to the beating pulse, ""So far, and no farther""? Why

   a woman in their own province. Beckmann, in his article on secret

ACT II.,SCENE II.�Old Moor's Bedchamber.,45,"HERMANN. They gave him a pair of colors. With the Prussians he flew on the
      wings of victory. We chanced to lie together, in the same tent. He talked
      much of his old father, and of happy days that were past�and of
      disappointed hopes�it brought the tears into our eyes."
ACT II.,SCENE II.�Old Moor's Bedchamber.,46,"OLD M. (buries his face in his pillow).�No more! Oh, no more!"
ACT II.,SCENE II.�Old Moor's Bedchamber.,47,"HERMANN. A week after, the fierce battle of Prague was fought�I can
      assure you your son behaved like a brave soldier. He performed prodigies
      that day in sight of the whole army. Five regiments were successively cut
      down by his side, and still he kept his ground. Fiery shells fell right
      and left, and still your son kept his ground. A ball shattered his right
      hand: he seized the colors with his left, and still he kept his ground!"
ACT II.,SCENE II.�Old Moor's Bedchamber.,48,"AMELIA (in transport). Hector, Hector! do you hear? He kept his ground!"
ACT II.,SCENE II.�Old Moor's Bedchamber.,49,"HERMANN. On the evening of the battle I found him on the same spot. He had
      sunk down, amidst a shower of hissing balls: with his left hand he was
      staunching the blood that flowed from a fearful wound; his right he had
      buried in the earth. ""Comrade!"" cried he when he saw me, ""there has been a
      report through the ranks that the general fell an hour ago�"" ""He is
      fallen,"" I replied, ""and thou?"" ""Well, then,"" he cried, withdrawing his
      left hand from the wound, ""let every brave soldier follow his general!""

      faltered he, with his dying breath, ""deliver it to my aged father; his
      son's blood is upon it�he is avenged�let him rejoice. Tell him
      that his curse drove me into battle and into death; that I fell in

      his breast at the same time. It is the very image of this young lady.

      all-powerful death has released thee from thy oath."" Now do you see�do
      you see? With hand stiffening in death he wrote it, with his warm life's
      blood he wrote it�wrote it on the solemn brink of eternity. His
      spirit lingered in his flight to unite Francis and Amelia."

ACT II.,SCENE II.�Old Moor's Bedchamber.,96,"OLD MOOR. Bring the Bible, my daughter, and read to me the story of Jacob

      leaves.)"

      Joseph no more among his children;�when he sought him in vain amidst
      his eleven sons;�and his lamentation when he heard that he was taken
      from him forever."

      found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.' (Exit FRANCIS

is ever said. Sleep and death are but twin-brothers. We will for once
change their names! Excellent, welcome sleep! We will call thee death!

accuse me at the bar of justice, or tell me to my face, thou art a
villain? Away, then, with this troublesome mask of humility and virtue!
Now you shall see Francis as he is, and tremble! My father was
overgentle in his demands, turned his domain into a family-circle, sat
blandly smiling at the gate, and saluted his peasants as brethren and
children. My brows shall lower upon you like thunderclouds; my lordly
name shall hover over you like a threatening comet over the mountains;
my forehead shall be your weather-glass! He would caress and fondle
the child that lifted its stubborn head against him. But fondling and
caressing is not my mode. I will drive the rowels of the spur into
their flesh, and give the scourge a trial. Under my rule it shall be
brought to pass that potatoes and small-beer shall be considered a
holiday treat; and woe to him who meets my eye with the audacious front
of health. Haggard want and crouching fear are my insignia; and in this

      earnest, a little army of them; you are the very prince of crimps."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,3,"SPIEGEL. Eh, brother? Eli? And proper fellows they are! You must confess
      the blessing of heaven is visibly upon me; I was a poor, hungry wretch,
      and had nothing but this staff when I went over the Jordan, and now there
      are eight-and-seventy of us, mostly ruined shopkeepers, rejected masters
      of arts, and law-clerks from the Swabian provinces. They are a rare set of
      fellows, brother, capital fellows, I promise you; they will steal you the
      very buttons off each other's trousers in perfect security, although in
      the teeth of a loaded musket,* and they live in clover and enjoy a
      reputation for forty miles round, which is quite astonishing."

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,5,"There is not a newspaper in which you will not find some little feat or
      other of that cunning fellow, Spiegelberg; I take in the papers for
      nothing else; they have described me from head to foot; you would think
      you saw me; they have not forgotten even my coat-buttons. But we lead them
      gloriously by the nose. The other day I went to the printing-office and
      pretended that I had seen the famous Spiegelberg, dictated to a
      penny-a-liner who was sitting there the exact image of a quack doctor in
      the town; the matter gets wind, the fellow is arrested, put to the rack,
      and in his anguish and stupidity he confesses the devil take me if he does
      not�confesses that he is Spiegelberg. Fire and fury! I was on the
      point of giving myself up to a magistrate rather than have my fair fame
      marred by such a poltroon; however, within three months he was hanged. I
      was obliged to stuff a right good pinch of snuff into my nose as some time
      afterwards I was passing the gibbet and saw the pseudo-Spiegelberg
      parading there in all his glory; and, while Spiegelberg's representative
      is dangling by the neck, the real Spiegelberg very quietly slips himself
      out of the noose, and makes jolly long noses behind the backs of these
      sagacious wiseacres of the law."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,6,RAZ. (laughing). You are still the same fellow you always were.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,7,"SPIEGEL. Ay, sure! body and soul. But I must tell you a bit of fun, my
      boy, which I had the other day in the nunnery of St. Austin. We fell in
      with the convent just about sunset; and as I had not fired a single
      cartridge all day,�you know I hate the diem perdidi as I hate
      death itself,�I was determined to immortalize the night by some
      glorious exploit, even though it should cost the devil one of his ears! We
      kept quite quiet till late in the night. At last all is as still as a
      mouse �the lights are extinguished. We fancy the nuns must be
      comfortably tucked up. So I take brother Grimm along with me, and order
      the others to wait at the gate till they hear my whistle�I secure
      the watchman, take the keys from him, creep into the maid-servants'
      dormitory, take. away all their clothes, and whisk the bundle out at the
      window. We go on from cell to cell, take away the clothes of one sister
      after another, and lastly those of the lady-abbess herself. Then I sound
      my whistle, and my fellows outside begin to storm and halloo as if
      doomsday was at hand, and away they rush with the devil's own uproar into
      the cells of the sisters! Ha, ha, ha! You should have seen the game�how
      the poor creatures were groping about in the dark for their petticoats,
      and how they took on when they found they were gone; and we, in the
      meantime, at 'em like very devils; and now, terrified and amazed, they
      wriggled under their bedclothes, or cowered together like cats behind the
      stoves. There was such shrieking and lamentation; and then the old beldame
      of an abbess�you know, brother, there is nothing in the world I hate
      so much as a spider and an old woman�so you may just fancy that
      wrinkled old hag standing naked before me, conjuring me by her maiden
      modesty forsooth! Well, I was determined to make short work of it; either,
      said I, out with your plate and your convent jewels and all your shining
      dollars, or�my fellows knew what I meant. The end of it was I
      brought away more than a thousand dollars' worth out of the convent, to
      say nothing of the fun, which will tell its own story in due time."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,8,"RAZ. (stamping on the ground). Hang it, that I should be absent on such an
      occasion."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,9,"SPIEGEL. Do you see? Now tell me, is not that life? 'Tis that which keeps
      one fresh and hale, and braces the body so that it swells hourly like an
      abbot's paunch; I don't know, but I think I must be endowed with some
      magnetic property, which attracts all the vagabonds on the face of the
      earth towards me like steel and iron."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,10,"RAZ. A precious magnet, indeed. But I should like to know, I'll be hanged
      if I shouldn't, what witchcraft you use?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,11,"SPIEGEL. Witchcraft? No need of witchcraft. All it wants is a head�a
      certain practical capacity which, of course, is not taken in with every
      spoonful of barley meal; for you know I have always said that an honest
      man may be carved out of any willow stump, but to make a rogue you must
      have brains; besides which it requires a national genius�a certain
      rascal-climate�so to speak.*"

   Grisons, for instance; that is what I call the thief's Athens.""
   This obnoxious passage has been carefully expunged from all the
   subsequent editions. It gave mortal offence to the Grison
   magistrates, who made a formal complaint of the insult and caused
   Schiller to be severely rebuked by the Grand Duke. This incident
   forms one of the epochs in our author's history.]"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,13,"RAZ. Brother, I have heard Italy celebrated for its artists."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,14,"SPIEGEL. Yes, yes! Give the devil his due. Italy makes a very noble
      figure; and if Germany goes on as it has begun, and if the Bible gets
      fairly kicked out, of which there is every prospect, Germany, too, may in
      time arrive at something respectable; but I should tell you that climate
      does not, after all, do such a wonderful deal; genius thrives everywhere;
      and as for the rest, brother, a crab, you know, will never become a
      pineapple, not even in Paradise. But to pursue our subject, where did I
      leave off?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,15,RAZ. You were going to tell me about your stratagems.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,16,"SPIEGEL. Ah, yes! my stratagems. Well, when you get into a town, the first
      thing is to fish out from the beadles, watchmen, and turnkeys, who are
      their best customers, and for these, accordingly, you must look out; then
      ensconce yourself snugly in coffee-houses, brothels, and beer-shops, and
      observe who cry out most against the cheapness of the times, the reduced
      five per cents., and the increasing nuisance of police regulations; who
      rail the loudest against government, or decry physiognomical science, and
      such like? These are the right sort of fellows, brother. Their honesty is
      as loose as a hollow tooth; you have only to apply your pincers. Or a
      shorter and even better plan is to drop a full purse in the public
      highway, conceal yourself somewhere near, and mark who finds it. Presently
      after you come running up, search, proclaim your loss aloud, and ask him,
      as it were casually, ""Have you perchance picked up a purse, sir?"" If he
      says ""Yes,"" why then the devil fails you. But if he denies it, with a
      ""pardon me, sir, I remember, I am sorry, sir,"" (he jumps up), then,
      brother, you've done the trick. Extinguish your lantern, cunning Diogenes,
      you have found your match."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,17,RAZ. You are an accomplished practitioner.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,18,"SPIEGEL. My God! As if that had ever been doubted. Well, then, when you
      have got your man into the net, you must take great care to land him
      cleverly. You see, my son, the way I have managed is thus: as soon as I
      was on the scent I stuck to my candidate like a leech; I drank brotherhood
      with him, and, nota bene, you must always pay the score. That costs
      a pretty penny, it is true, but never mind that. You must go further;
      introduce him to gaming-houses and brothels; entangle him in broils and
      rogueries till he becomes bankrupt in health and strength, in purse,
      conscience, and reputation; for I must tell you, by the way, that you will
      make nothing of it unless you ruin both body and soul. Believe me,
      brother, and I have experienced it more than fifty times in my extensive
      practice, that when the honest man is once ousted from his stronghold, the
      devil has it all his own way�the transition is then as easy as from
      a whore to a devotee. But hark! What bang was that?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,19,RAZ. It was thunder; go on.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,20,"SPIEGEL. Or, there is a yet shorter and still better way. You strip your
      man of all he has, even to his very shirt, and then he will come to you of
      his own accord; you won't teach me to suck eggs, brother; ask that
      copper-faced fellow there. My eyes, how neatly I got him into my meshes. I
      showed him forty ducats, which I promised to give him if he would bring me
      an impression in wax of his master's keys. Only think, the stupid brute
      not only does this, but actually brings me�I'll be hanged if he did
      not�the keys themselves; and then thinks to get the money. ""Sirrah,""
      said I, ""are you aware that I am going to carry these keys straight to the
      lieutenant of police, and to bespeak a place for you on the gibbet?"" By
      the powers! you should have seen how the simpleton opened his eyes, and
      began to shake from head to foot like a dripping poodle. ""For heaven's
      sake, sir, do but consider. I will� will�"" ""What will you?
      Will you at once cut your stick and go to the devil with me?"" ""Oh, with
      all my heart, with great pleasure."" Ha! ha! ha! my fine fellow; toasted
      cheese is the thing to catch mice with; do have a good laugh at him,
      Razman; ha! ha! ha!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,21,"RAZ. Yes, yes, I must confess. I shall inscribe that lesson in letters of
      gold upon the tablet of my brain. Satan must know his people right well to
      have chosen you for his factor."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,22,"SPIEGEL. Eh, brother? Eli? And if I help him to half a score of fellows he
      will, of course, let me off scot-free�publishers, you know, always
      give one copy in ten gratis to those who collect subscribers for them; why
      should the devil be more of a Jew? Razman, I smell powder."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,23,"RAZ. Zounds! I smelt it long ago. You may depend upon it there has being
      something going forward hereabouts. Yes, yes! I can tell you, Spiegelberg,
      you will be welcome to our captain with your recruits; he, too, has got
      hold of some brave fellows."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,24,"SPIEGEL. But look at mine! at mine here, bah!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,25,"RAZ. Well, well! they may be tolerably expert in the finger department,
      but, I tell you, the fame of our captain has tempted even some honorable
      men to join his staff."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,26,SPIEGEL. So much the worse.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,27,"RAZ. Without joking. And they are not ashamed to serve under such a
      leader. He does not commit murder as we do for the sake of plunder; and as
      to money, as soon as he had plenty of it at command, he did not seem to
      care a straw for it; and his third of the booty, which belongs to him of
      right, he gives away to orphans, or supports promising young men with it
      at college. But should he happen to get a country squire into his clutches
      who grinds down his peasants like cattle, or some gold-laced villain, who
      warps the law to his own purposes, and hoodwinks the eyes of justice with
      his gold, or any chap of that kidney; then, my boy, he is in his element,
      and rages like a very devil, as if every fibre in his body were a fury."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,28,SPIEGEL. Humph!
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,29,"RAZ. The other day we were told at a tavern that a rich count from
      Ratisbon was about to pass through, who had gained the day in a suit worth
      a million of money by the craftiness of his lawyer. The captain was just
      sitting down to a game of backgammon. ""How many of us are there?"" said he
      to me, rising in haste. I saw him bite his nether lip, which he never does
      except when he is very determined. ""Not more than five,"" I replied.
      ""That's enough,"" he said; threw his score on the table, left the wine he
      had ordered untouched, and off we went. The whole time he did not utter a
      syllable, but walked aloof and alone, only asking us from time to time
      whether we heard anything, and now and then desiring us to lay our ears to
      the ground. At last the count came in sight, his carriage heavily laden,
      the lawyer, seated by his side, an outrider in advance, and two horsemen
      riding behind. Then you should have seen the man. With a pistol in each
      hand he ran before us to the carriage,�and the voice with which he
      thundered, ""Halt!"" The coachman, who would not halt, was soon toppled from
      his box; the count fired out of the carriage and missed�the horseman
      fled. ""Your money, rascal!"" cried Moor, with his stentorian voice. The
      count lay like a bullock under the axe: ""And are you the rogue who turns
      justice into a venal prostitute?"" The lawyer shook till his teeth
      chattered again; and a dagger soon stuck in his body, like a stake in a
      vineyard. ""I have done my part,"" cried the captain, turning proudly away;
      ""the plunder is your affair."" And with this he vanished into the forest."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,30,"SPIEGEL. Hum! hum! Brother, what I told you just now remains between
      ourselves; there is no occasion for his knowing it. You understand me?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,31,"RAZ. Yes, yes, I understand!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,32,SPIEGEL. You know the man! He has his own notions! You understand me?
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,33,"RAZ. Oh, I quite understand."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,34,(Enter SCHWARZ at full speed).
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,35,Who's there? What is the matter? Any travellers in the forest?
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,36,"SCHWARZ. Quick, quick! Where are the others? Zounds! there you stand
      gossiping! Don't you know�do you know nothing of it?�that poor
      Roller�"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,37,PAZ. What of him? What of him?
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,38,"SCHWARZ. He's hanged, that's all, and four others with him�"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,39,RAz. Roller hanged? S'death! when? How do you know?
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,40,"SCHWARZ. He has been in limbo more than three weeks, and we knew nothing
      of it. He was brought up for examination three several days, and still we
      heard nothing. They put him to the rack to make him tell where the captain
      was to be found�but the brave fellow would not slip. Yesterday he
      got his sentence, and this morning was dispatched express to the devil!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,41,RAZ. Confound it! Does the captain know?
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,42,"SCHWARZ. He heard of it only yesterday. He foamed like a wild boar. You
      know that Roller was always an especial favorite; and then the rack! Ropes
      and scaling-ladders were conveyed to the prison, but in vain. Moor himself
      got access to him disguised as a Capuchin monk, and proposed to change
      clothes with him; but Roller absolutely refused; whereupon the captain
      swore an oath that made our very flesh creep. He vowed that he would light
      a funeral pile for him, such as had never yet graced the bier of royalty,
      one that should burn them all to cinders. I fear for the city. He has long
      owed it a grudge for its intolerable bigotry; and you know, when he says,
      ""I'll do it,"" the thing is as good as done."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,43,"RAZ. That is true! I know the captain. If he had pledged his word to the
      devil to go to hell he never would pray again, though half a pater-noster
      would take him to heaven. Alas! poor Roller!�poor Roller!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,44,SPIEGEL. Memento mori! But it does not concern me. (Hums a tune).
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,45,"Should I happen to pass the gallows stone,
         I shall just take a sight with one eye,
        And think to myself, you may dangle alone,
         Who now, sir, 's the fool, you or I?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,46,"RAZ. (Jumping up). Hark! a shot! (Firing and noise is heard behind the
      scenes)."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,47,SPIEGEL. Another!

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,49,"(Voices behind the scenes are heard singing).

        The Nurnbergers deem it the wisest plan,
        Never to hang till they've caught their man.
                         Da capo."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,50,"SCHWEITZER and ROLLER (behind the scenes). Holla, ho! Holla, ho!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,51,RAZ. Roller! by all the devils! Roller!
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,52,"SCHWEITZER and ROLLER (still behind the scenes). Razman! Schwarz!
      Spiegelberg! Razman!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,53,"RAZ. Roller! Schweitzer! Thunder and lightning! Fire and fury! (They run
      towards him.)"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,54,"Enter CHARLES VON MOOR (on horseback), SCHWEITZER, ROLLER, GRIMM,
      SCHUFTERLE, and a troop of ROBBERS covered with dust and mud."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,55,"CHARLES (leaping from his horse) Liberty! Liberty!�Thou art on terra
      firma, Roller! Take my horse, Schweitzer, and wash him with wine. (Throws
      himself on the ground.) That was hot work!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,56,"RAZ. (to ROLLER). Well, by the fires of Pluto! Art thou risen from the
      wheel?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,57,SCHWARZ. Art thou his ghost? or am I a fool? or art thou really the man?
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,58,"ROLLER (still breathless). The identical�alive�whole.�Where
      do you think I come from?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,59,"SCHWARZ. It would puzzle a witch to tell! The staff was already broken
      over you."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,60,"ROLLER. Ay, that it was, and more than that! I come straightway from the
      gallows. Only let me get my breath. Schweitzer will tell you all. Give me
      a glass of brandy! You there too, Spiegelberg! I thought we should have
      met again in another place. But give me a glass of brandy! my bones are
      tumbling to pieces. Oh, my captain! Where is my captain?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,61,"SCHWARZ. Have patience, man, have patience. Just tell me�say�come,
      let's hear�how did you escape? In the name of wonder how came we to
      get you back again? My brain is bewildered. From the gallows, you say?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,62,"ROLLER (swallows a flask of brandy). Ah, that is capital! that warms the
      inside! Straight from the gallows, I tell you. You stand there amid stare
      as if that was impossible. I can assure you, I was not more than three
      paces from that blessed ladder, on which I was to mount to Abraham's bosom�so
      near, so very near, that I was sold, skin and all, to the dissecting-room!
      The fee-simple of my life was not worth a pinch of snuff. To the captain I
      am indebted for breath, and liberty, and life."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,63,"SCHWEITZER. It was a trick worth the telling. We had heard the day before,
      through our spies, that Roller was in the devil's own pickle; and unless
      the vault of heaven fell in suddenly he would, on the morrow �that
      is, to-day�go the way of all flesh. Up! says the captain, and follow
      me�what is not a friend worth? Whether we save him or not, we will
      at least light him up a funeral pile such as never yet honored royalty;
      one which shall burn them black and blue. The whole troop was summoned. We
      sent Roller a trusty messenger, who conveyed the notice to him in a little
      billet, which he slipped into his porridge."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,64,ROLLER. I had but small hope of success.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,65,"SCHWEITZER. We waited till the thoroughfares were clear. The whole town
      was out after the sight; equestrians, pedestrians, carriages, all
      pell-mell; the noise and the gibbet-psalm sounded far and wide. Now, says
      the captain, light up, light up! We all flew like darts; they set fire to
      the city in three-and-thirty places at once; threw burning firebrands on
      the powder-magazine, and into the churches and granaries. Morbleu! in less
      than a quarter of an hour a northeaster, which, like us, must have owed a
      grudge to the city, came seasonably to our aid, and helped to lift the
      flames up to the highest gables. Meanwhile we ran up and down the streets
      like furies, crying, fire! ho! fire! ho! in every direction. There was
      such howling�screaming-tumult�fire-bells tolling. And
      presently the powder-magazine blew up into the air with a crash as if the
      earth were rent in twain, heaven burst to shivers, and hell sunk ten
      thousand fathoms deeper."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,66,"ROLLER. Now my guards looked behind them�there lay the city, like
      Sodom and Gomorrah�the whole horizon was one mass of fire,
      brimstone, and smoke; and forty hills echoed and reflected the infernal
      prank far and wide. A panic seized them all�I take advantage of the
      moment, and, quick as lightning�my fetters had been taken off, so
      nearly was my time come�while my guards were looking away petrified,
      like Lot's wife, I shot off�tore through the crowd�and away!
      After running some sixty paces I throw off my clothes, plunge into the
      river, and swim along under water till I think they have lost sight of me.
      My captain stood ready, with horses and clothes�and here I am. Moor!
      Moor! I only wish that you may soon get into just such another scrape that
      I may requite you in like manner."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,67,"RAZ. A brutal wish, for which you deserve to be hanged. It was a glorious
      prank, though."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,68,"ROLLER. It was help in need; you cannot judge of it. You should have
      marched, like me, with a rope round your neck, travelling to your grave in
      the living body, and seen their horrid sacramental forms and hangman's
      ceremonies�and then, at every reluctant step, as the struggling feet
      were thrust forward, to see the infernal machine, on which I was to be
      elevated, glaring more and more hideously in the blaze of a noonday sun�and
      the hangman's rapscallions watching for their prey �and the horrible
      psalm-singing�the cursed twang still rings in my ears�and the
      screeching hungry ravens, a whole flight of them, who were hovering over
      the half-rotten carcass of my predecessor. To see all this�ay, more,
      to have a foretaste of the blessedness which was in store for me! Brother,
      brother! And then, all of a sudden, the signal of deliverance. It was an
      explosion as if the vault of heaven were rent in twain. Hark ye, fellows!
      I tell you, if a man were to leap out of a fiery furnace into a freezing
      lake he could not feel the contrast half so strongly as I did when I
      gained the opposite shore."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,69,"SPIEGEL. (Laughs.) Poor wretch! Well, you have got over it. (Pledges him).
      Here's to a happy regeneration!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,70,"ROLLER (flings away his glass). No, by all the treasures of Mammon, I
      should not like to go through it a second time. Death is something more
      than a harlequin's leap, and its terrors are even worse than death itself."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,71,"SPIEGEL. And the powder-magazine leaping into the air! Don't you see it
      now, Razman? That was the reason the air stunk so, for miles round, of
      brimstone, as if the whole wardrobe of Moloch was being aired under the
      open firmament. It was a master-stroke, captain! I envy you for it."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,72,"SCHWEITZER. If the town makes it a holiday-treat to see our comrade killed
      by a baited hog, why the devil should we scruple to sacrifice the city for
      the rescue of our comrade? And, by the way, our fellows had the extra
      treat of being able to plunder worse than the old emperor. Tell me, what
      have you sacked?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,73,"ONE OF THE TROOP. I crept into St. Stephen's church during the hubbub, and
      tore the gold lace from the altarcloth. The patron saint, thought I to
      myself, can make gold lace out of packthread."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,74,"SCHWEITZER. 'Twas well done. What is the use of such rubbish in a church?
      They offer it to the Creator, who despises such trumpery, while they leave
      his creatures to die of hunger. And you, Sprazeler�where did you
      throw your net?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,75,"A SECOND. I and Brizal broke into a merchant's store, and have brought
      stuffs enough with us to serve fifty men."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,76,A THIRD. I have filched two gold watches and a dozen silver spoons.
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,77,"SCHWEITZER. Well done, well done! And we have lighted them a bonfire that
      will take a fortnight to put out again. And, to get rid of the fire, they
      must ruin the city with water. Do you know, Schufterle, how many lives
      have been lost?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,78,"SCHUF. Eighty-three, they say. The powder-magazine alone blew threescore
      to atoms."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,79,"CHARLES (very seriously). Roller, thou art dearly bought."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,80,"SCHUF. Bah! bah! What of that? If they had but been men it would have been
      another matter�but they were babes in swaddling clothes, and
      shrivelled old nurses that kept the flies from them, and dried-up
      stove-squatters who could not crawl to the door�patients whining for
      the doctor, who, with his stately gravity, was marching to the sport. All
      that had the use of their legs had gone forth in the sight, and nothing
      remained at home but the dregs of the city."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,81,"CHARLES. Alas for the poor creatures! Sick people, sayest thou, old men
      and infants?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,82,"SCHUF. Ay, the devil go with them! And lying-in-women into the bargain;
      and women far gone with child, who were afraid of miscarrying under the
      gibbet; and young mothers, who thought the sight might do them a mischief,
      and mark the gallows upon the foreheads of their unborn babes�poor
      poets, without a shoe, because their only pair had been sent to the
      cobbler to mend�and other such vermin, not worth the trouble of
      mentioning. As I chanced to pass by a cottage I heard a great squalling
      inside. I looked in; and, when I came to examine, what do you think it
      was? Why, an infant�a plump and ruddy urchin�lying on the
      floor under a table which was just beginning to burn. Poor little wretch!
      said I, you will be cold there, and with that I threw it into the flames!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,83,"CHARLES. Indeed, Schufterle? Then may those flames burn in thy bosom
to all eternity! Avaunt, monster! Never let me see thee again in my
troop! What! Do you murmur? Do you hesitate? Who dares hesitate when
I command? Away with him, I say! And there are others among you ripe
for my vengeance. I know thee, Spiegelberg. But I will step in among
you ere long, and hold a fearful muster-roll.

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,84,"CHARLES (alone, walking up and down in great agitation). Hear them not,
      thou avenger in heaven! How can I avert it? Art thou to blame, great God,
      if thy engines, pestilence, and famine, and floods, overwhelm the just
      with the unjust? Who can stay the flame, which is kindled to destroy the
      hornet's nest, from extending to the blessed harvest? Oh! fie on the
      slaughter of women, and children, and the sick! How this deed weighs me
      down! It has poisoned my fairest achievements! There he stands, poor fool,
      abashed and disgraced in the sight of heaven; the boy that presumed to
      wield Jove's thunder, and overthrew pigmies when he should have crushed
      Titans. Go, go! 'tis not for thee, puny son of clay, to wield the avenging
      sword of sovereign justice! Thou didst fail at thy first essay. Here,

      Come, be jolly, Roller! I have long wished to have a bout with those

      assembled? I hope we have powder enough?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,92,"RAZ. Powder, I believe you; but we are only eighty in all and therefore

      their lives for tenpence; and are we not fighting for our necks? We will
      pour into them like a deluge, and fire volleys upon their heads like
      crashes of thunder. But where the devil is the captain."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,94,SPIEGEL. He forsakes us in this extremity. Is there no hope of escape?

      appear the more formidable. And let all the dogs be unchained, and set on
      upon their ranks, that they may be broken and dispersed and run in the way
      of our fire. We three, Roller, Schweitzer, and myself, will fight wherever
      the fray is hottest."

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,127,"FATHER DOM. (heated). Abominable wretch! Avaunt! Does not the blood of a

      carry off the consecrated vessels of the sanctissimum? Hast thou
      not flung firebrands into our godly city, and brought down the
      powder-magazine upon the heads of devout Christians? (Clasps his hands).
      Horrible, horrible wickedness! that stinketh in the nostrils of Heaven,

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,128,"CHARLES. Masterly guesses thus far! But now, sir, to the point! What is it
      that the right worshipful justices wish to convey to me through you?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,129,"FATHER Dom. What you are not worthy to receive. Look around you,
      incendiary! As far as your eye can reach you are environed by our horsemen�there
      is no chance of escape. As surely as cherries grow on these oaks, and
      peaches on these firs, so surely shall you turn your backs upon these oaks

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,131,"FATHER DOM. Hear, then, what mercy and forbearance justice shows towards

      nine-and-seventy men, of whom I am the captain, and not one of them has
      been taught to trot at a signal, or learned to dance to the music of
      artillery; while yonder stand seventeen hundred men grown gray under the
      musket. But now listen! Thus says Moor, the captain of incendiaries. It is
      true I have slain a count of the empire, burnt and plundered the church of
      St. Dominic, flung firebrands into your bigoted city, and brought down the
      powder-magazine upon the heads of devout Christians. But that is not all,�I
      have done more. (He holds out his right hand.) Do you observe these four
      costly rings, one on each finger? Go and report punctually to their
      worships, on whose sentence hangs life or death what you shall hear and
      see. This ruby I drew from the finger of a minister, whom I stretched at
      the feet of his prince, during the chase. He had fawned himself up from
      the lowest dregs, to be the first favorite;�the ruin of his neighbor
      was his ladder to greatness�orphans' tears helped him to mount it.
      This diamond I took from a lord treasurer, who sold offices of honor and
      trust to the highest bidder, and drove the sorrowing patriot from his
      door. This opal I wear in honor of a priest of your cloth, whom I
      dispatched with my own hand, after he had publicly deplored in his pulpit
      the waning power of the Inquisition. I could tell you more stories about
      my rings, but that I repent the words I have already wasted upon you�"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,136,FATHER DOM. O Pharaoh! Pharaoh!
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,137,"CHARLES. Do you hear it? Did you mark that sigh? Does he not stand there
      as if he were imploring fire from heaven to descend and destroy this troop
      of Korah? He pronounces judgment with a shrug of the shoulders, and
      eternal damnation with a Christian ""Alas!"" Is it possible for humanity to
      be so utterly blind? He who has the hundred eyes of Argus to spy out the
      faults of his brother�can he be so totally blind to his own? They
      thunder forth from their clouds about gentleness and forbearance, while
      they sacrifice human victims to the God of love as if he were the fiery
      Moloch. They preach the love of one's neighbor, while they drive the aged
      and blind with curses from their door. They rave against covetousness; yet
      for the sake of gold they have depopulated Peru, and yoked the natives,
      like cattle, to their chariots. They rack their brains in wonder to
      account for the creation of a Judas Iscariot, yet the best of them would
      betray the whole Trinity for ten shekels. Out upon you, Pharisees! ye
      falsifiers of truth! ye apes of Deity! You are not ashamed to kneel before
      crucifixes and altars; you lacerate your backs with thongs, and mortify
      your flesh with fasting; and with these pitiful mummeries you think, fools
      as you are, to veil the eyes of Him whom, with the same breath, you
      address as the Omniscient, just as the great are the most bitterly mocked
      by those who flatter them while they pretend to hate flatterers. You boast
      of your honesty and your exemplary conduct; but the God who sees through
      your hearts would be wroth with Him that made you, were He not the same
      that had also created the monsters of the Nile. Away with him out of my
      sight!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,138,FATHER DOM. That such a miscreant should be so proud!
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,139,"CHARLES. That's not all. Now I will speak proudly. Go and tell the right
      worshipful justices�who set men's lives upon the cast of a die�
      I am not one of those thieves who conspire with sleep and midnight, and
      play the hero and the lordling on a scaling-ladder. What I have done I
      shall no doubt hereafter be doomed to read in the register of heaven; but
      with his miserable ministers of earth I will waste no more words. Tell
      your masters that my trade is retribution�vengeance my occupation!

ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,140,"FATHER DOM. Then you despise mercy and forbearance?�-Be it so, I
      have done with you. (Turning to the troop.) Now then, sirs, you shall hear
      what the high powers direct me to make known to you!�If you will
      instantly deliver up to me this condemned malefactor, bound hand and foot,
      you shall receive a full pardon�your enormities shall be entirely
      blotted out, even from memory. The holy church will receive you, like lost
      sheep, with renewed love, into her maternal bosom, and the road to
      honorable employment shall be open to you all. (With a triumphant smile.)
      Now sir! how does your majesty relish this? Come on! bind him! and you are
      free!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,141,"CHARLES. Do you hear that? Do you hear it? What startles you? Why do you
      hesitate? They offer you freedom�you that are already their
      prisoners. They grant you your lives, and that is no idle pretence, for it
      is clear you are already condemned felons. They promise you honor and
      emolument; and, on the other hand, what can you hope for, even should you
      be victorious to-day, but disgrace, and curses, and persecution? They
      ensure you the pardon of Heaven; you that are actually damned. There is
      not a single hair on any of you that is not already bespoke in hell. Do
      you still hesitate? are you staggered? Is it so difficult, then, to choose
      between heaven and hell?�Do put in a word, father!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,142,"FATHER DOM. (aside.) Is the fellow crazy? (Aloud.) Perhaps you are afraid
      that this is a trap to catch you alive?�Read it yourselves! Here�is
      the general pardon fully signed. (He hands a paper to SCHWEITZER.) Can you
      still doubt?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,143,"CHARLES. Only see! only see! What more can you require? Signed with their
      own hands! It is mercy beyond all bounds! Or are you afraid of their
      breaking their word, because you have heard it said that no faith need be
      kept with traitors? Dismiss that fear! Policy alone would constrain them
      to keep their word, even though it should merely have been pledged to old
      Nick. Who hereafter would believe them? How could they trade with it a
      second time? I would take my oath upon it that they mean it sincerely.
      They know that I am the man who has goaded you on and incited you; they
      believe you innocent. They look upon your crimes as so many juvenile
      errors�exuberances of rashness. It is I alone they want. I must pay
      the penalty. Is it not so, father?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,144,"FATHER DOM. What devil incarnate is it that speaks out of him? Of course
      it is so�of course. The fellow turns my brain."
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,145,"CHARLES. What! no answer yet? Do you think it possible to cut your way
      through yon phalanx? Only look round you! just look round! You surely do
      not reckon upon that; that were indeed a childish conceit�Or do you
      flatter yourselves that you will fall like heroes, because you saw that I
      rejoiced in the prospect of the fight? Oh, do not console yourself with
      the thought! You are not MOOR. You are miserable thieves! wretched tools
      of my great designs! despicable as the rope in the hand of the hangman!
      No! no! Thieves do not fall like heroes. Life must be the hope of thieves,
      for something fearful has to follow. Thieves may well be allowed to quake
      at the fear of death. Hark! Do you hear their horns echoing through the
      forest? See there! how their glittering sabres threaten! What! are you
      still irresolute? are you mad? are you insane? It is unpardonable. Do you
      imagine I shall thank you for my life? I disdain your sacrifice!"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,146,"FATHER DOM. (in utter amazement). I shall go mad! I must be gone! Was the
      like ever heard of?"
ACT II.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,147,"CHARLES. Or are you afraid that I shall stab myself, and so by suicide put
      an end to the bargain, which only holds good if I am given up alive? No,
      comrades! that is a vain fear. Here, I fling away my dagger, and my
      pistols, and this phial of poison, which might have been a treasure to me.
      I am so wretched that I have lost the power even over my own life. What!
      still in suspense? Or do you think, perhaps, that I shall stand on my
      defence when you try to seize me? See here! I bind my right hand to this
      oak-branch; now I am quite defenceless, a child may overpower me. Who is

      master here."
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,9,"FRANCIS. Precisely so; that is the very subject on which I wish to
      communicate with you. Maximilian von Moor is gone to the tomb of his
      ancestors. I am master. But I wish�to be so in the fullest sense,
      Amelia. You know what you have been to our house always regarded as Moor's
      daughter, his love for you will survive even death itself; that,
      assuredly, you will never forget?"
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,10,"AMELIA. Never, never! Who could be so unfeeling as to drown the memory of
      it in festive banqueting?"
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,11,"FRANCIS. It is your duty to repay the love of the father to his sons; and
      Charles is dead. Ha! you are struck with amazement; dizzy with the
      thought! To be sure 'tis a flattering and an elating prospect which may
      well overpower the pride of a woman. Francis tramples under foot the hopes
      of the noblest and the richest, and offers his heart, his hand, and with
      them all his gold, his castles, and his forests to a poor, and, but for
      him, destitute orphan. Francis�the feared�voluntarily declares
      himself Amelia's slave!"

      Amelia, his betrothed, call thee husband? Thou?"
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,13,"FRANCIS. Be not so violent, most gracious princess! It is true that
      Francis does not come before you like a whining Celadon�'tis true he
      has not learned, like a lovesick swain of Arcadia, to sigh forth his
      amorous plaints to the echo of caves and rocks. Francis speaks�and,
      when not answered, commands!"
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,14,"AMELIA. Commands? thou reptile! Command me? And what if I laughed your
      command to scorn?"
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,15,"FRANCIS. That you will hardly do. There are means, too, which I know of,
      admirably adapted to humble the pride of a capricious, stubborn girl�cloisters
      and walls!"
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,16,"AMELIA. Excellent! delightful! to be forever secure within cloisters and
      walls from thy basilisk look, and to have abundant leisure to think and

ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,17,"FRANCIS. Ha! Is that it? Beware! Now you have taught me the art of
      tormenting you. The sight of me shall, like a fiery-haired fury, drive out
      of your head these eternal phantasies of Charles. Francis shall be the
      dread phantom ever lurking behind the image of your beloved, like the
      fiend-dog that guards the subterranean treasure. I will drag you to church
      by the hair, and sword in hand wring the nuptial vow from your soul. By
      main force will I ascend your virginal couch, and storm your haughty
      modesty with still greater haughtiness."

      passes you in the street. Ay, gnash your teeth as fiercely as you please�scatter
      fire and destruction from your eyes� the fury of a woman piques my

      you? I am only a woman, but a woman enraged. Dare to approach, and this
      steel shall strike your lascivious heart to the core �the spirit of
      my uncle will guide my hand. Avaunt, this instant! (She drives him away)."
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,21,"Ah! how different I feel! Now I breathe again�I feel strong as the
      snorting steed, ferocious as the tigress when she springs upon the
      ruthless destroyer of her cubs. To a cloister, did he say? I thank thee
      for the happy thought! Now has disappointed love found a place of refuge�the
      cloister�the Redeemer's bosom is the sanctuary of disappointed love.

ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,23,"In the acting edition the following scene occurs between Herman and
      Francis, immediately before that with Amelia. As Schiller himself thought
      this among the happiest of his additions, and regretted that it was
      ""entirely and very unfortunately overlooked in the first edition,"" it
      seems desirable to introduce it here as well as the soliloquy immediately
      following, which has acquired some celebrity."
ACT III.,SCENE III.�THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.,24,
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,1,Enter HERMANN.
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,2,"FRANCIS. Ha! Welcome, my Euryalus! My prompt and trusty instrument!"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,3,"HERMANN (abruptly and peevishly). You sent for me, count�why?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,4,FRANCIS. That you might put the seal to your master-piece.
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,5,HERMANN (gruffly). Indeed?
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,6,FRANCIS. Give the picture its finishing touch.
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,7,HERMANN. Poh! Poh!
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,8,"FRANCIS (startled). Shall I call the carriage? We'll arrange the business
      during the drive?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,9,"HERMANN (scornfully). No ceremony, sir, if you please. For any business we
      may have to arrange there is room enough between these four walls. At all
      events I'll just say a few words to you by way of preface, which may save
      your lungs some unnecessary exertion."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,10,FRANCIS (reservedly). Hum! And what may those words be?
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,11,"HERMANN (with bitter irony). ""You shall have Amelia�and that from my
      hand�"""
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,12,FRANCIS (with astonishment). Hermann!
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,13,"HERMANN (as before, with his back turned on FRANCIS). ""Amelia will become
      the plaything of my will�and you may easily guess the rest-in short
      all will go as we wish"" (Breaks into an indignant laugh, and then turns
      haughtily to FRANCIS.) Now, Count von Moor, what have you to say to me?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,14,FRANCIS (evasively). To thee? Nothing. I had something to say to Hermann.�
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,15,"HERMANN, No evasion. Why was I sent for hither? Was it to be your dupe a
      second time! and to hold the ladder for a thief to mount? to sell my soul
      for a hangman s fee? What else did you want with me?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,16,"FRANCIS (as if recollecting). Ha! It just occurs to me! We must not forget
      the main point. Did not my steward mention it to you? I wanted to talk to
      you about the dowry."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,17,"HERMANN. This is mere mockery sir; or, if not mockery, something worse.
      Moor, take care of yourself-beware how you kindle my fury, Moor. We are
      alone! And I have still an unsullied name to stake against yours! Trust
      not the devil, although he be of your own raising."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,18,"FRANCIS (with dignity). Does this deportment become thee towards thy
      sovereign and gracious master? Tremble, slave!"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,19,"HERMANN (ironically). For fear of your displeasure, I suppose? What
      signifies your displeasure to a man who is at war with himself? Fie, Moor.
      I already abhor you as a villain; let me not despise you for a fool. I can
      open graves, and restore the dead to life! Which of us now is the slave?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,20,"FRANCIS (in a conciliating tone). Come, my good friend, be discreet, and
      do not prove faithless."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,21,"HERMANN. Pshaw! To expose a wretch like you is here the best discretion�to
      keep faith with you would be an utter want of sense. Faith? with whom?
      Faith with the prince of liars? Oh, I shudder at the thought of such
      faith. A very little timely faithlessness would have almost made a saint
      of me. But patience! patience! Revenge is cunning in resources."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,22,"FRANCIS. Ah, by-the-by, I just remember. You lately lost a purse with a
      hundred louis in it, in this apartment. I had almost forgotten it. Here,
      my good friend! take back what belongs to you. (Offers him a purse)."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,23,"HERMANN (throws it scornfully at his feet). A curse on your Judas bribe!
      It is the earnest-money of hell. You once before thought to make my
      poverty a pander to my conscience�but you were mistaken, count!
      egregiously mistaken. That purse of gold came most opportunely�to
      maintain certain persons."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,24,"FRANCIS (terrified). Hermann! Hermann! Let me not suspect certain things
      of you. Should you have done anything contrary to my instructions�you
      would be the vilest of traitors!"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,25,"HERMANN (exultingly). Should I? Should I really? Well then count, let me
      give you a little piece of information! (Significantly.) I will fatten up
      your infamy, and add fuel to your doom. The book of your misdeeds shall
      one day be served up as a banquet, and all the world be invited to partake
      of it. (Contemptuously.) Do you understand me now, my most sovereign,
      gracious, and excellent master?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,26,"FRANCIS (starts up, losing all command of himself). Ha! Devil! Deceitful
      impostor! (Striking his forehead.) To think that I should stake my fortune
      on the caprice of an idiot! That was madness! (Throws himself, in great
      excitement, on a couch.)"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,27,HERMANN (whistles through his fingers). Wheugh! the biter bit!�
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,28,"FRANCIS (biting his lip). But it is true, and ever will be true�that
      there is no thread so feebly spun, or which snaps asunder so readily, as
      that which weaves the bands of guilt!�"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,29,"HERMANN. Gently! Gently! Are angels, then, superseded, that devils turn
      moralists?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,30,"FRANCIS (starts up abruptly; to HERMANN with a malignant laugh). And
      certain persons will no doubt acquire much honor by making the discovery?"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,31,"HERMANN (clapping his hands). Masterly! Inimitable! You play your part to
      admiration! First you lure the credulous fool into the slough, and then
      chuckle at the success of your malice, and cry ""Woe be to you sinner!""
      (Laughing and clenching his teeth.) Oh, how cleverly these imps off the
      devil manoeuvre. But, count (clapping him on the shoulder) you have not
      yet got your lesson quite perfect�by Heavens! You first learn what
      the losing gamester will hazard. Set fire to the powder-magazine, says the
      pirate, and blow all to hell�both friend and foe!"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,32,"FRANCIS (runs to the wall, and takes down a pistol). Here is treason! I
      must be resolute�"
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,33,"HERMANN (draws a pistol as quickly from his pocket, and presents it at
      him). Don't trouble yourself�one must be prepared for everything
      with you."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,34,"FRANCIS (lets the pistol fall, and throws himself on the sofa in great
      confusion). Only keep my council till�till I have collected my
      thoughts."
ACT III.,SCENE VIII.,35,"HERMANN. I suppose till you have hired a dozen assassins to silence my
tongue forever! Is it not so! But (in his ear) the secret is committed
to paper, which my heirs will publish.

ACT III.,SCENE IX.,1,"FRANCIS, solus."
ACT III.,SCENE IX.,2,"Francis! Francis! Francis! What is all this? Where was thy courage?
where thy once so fertile wit? Woe! Woe! And to be betrayed by thy
own instruments! The pillars of my good fortune are tottering to their
fall, the fences are broken down, and the raging enemy is already
bursting in upon me. Well! this calls for some bold and sudden resolve!
What if I went in person�and secretly plunged this sword in his body?
A wounded man is but a child. Quick! I'll do it. (He walks with a
resolute step to the end of the stage, but stops suddenly as if overcome
by sensations of horror). Who are these gliding behind me? (Rolling
his eyes fearfully) Faces such as I have never yet beheld. What
hideous yells do I hear! I feel that I have courage�courage! oh yes to
overflowing! But if a mirror should betray me? or my shadow! or the
whistling of the murderous stroke! Ugh! Ugh! How my hair bristles! A
shudder creeps through my frame. (He lets a poigniard fall from under
his clothes.) I am no coward�perhaps somewhat too tenderhearted. Yes!
that is it! These are the last struggles of expiring virtue. I revere
them. I should indeed be a monster were I to become the murderer of my
own brother. No! no! no! That thought be far from me! Let me cherish
this vestige of humanity. I will not murder. Nature, thou hast
conquered. I still feel something here that seems like�affection. He

ACT III.,SCENE IX.,5,"HERMANN. I must throw this weight from my soul before it drags it down to
      hell. (Falls down before her.) Pardon! pardon! I have grievously injured
      you, Lady Amelia!"
ACT III.,SCENE IX.,6,AMELIA. Arise! depart! I will hear nothing. (Going.)

ACT III.,SCENE IX.,8,"AMELIA. Not another word. I forgive you. Depart in peace. (In the act of
      going.)"
ACT III.,SCENE IX.,9,"HERMANN. Only one word�listen; it will restore all your peace of

ACT III.,SCENE IX.,10,"AMELIA (turning back and looking at him with astonishment). How, friend?
      Who in heaven or on earth can restore my peace of mind?"
ACT III.,SCENE IX.,11,HERMANN. One word from my lips can do it. Hear me!
ACT III.,SCENE IX.,12,"AMELIA (seizing his hand with compassion). Good sir! Can one word from thy
      lips burst asunder the portals of eternity?"

      my limbs were all shattered. My tongue is as dry as a potsherd (SCHWEITZER
      disappears unperceived.) I would ask one of you to bring me a handful of
      water from that stream, but you are all tired to death."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,3,SCHWARZ. Our wine-flasks too are all empty.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,4,"CHARLES. See how beautiful the harvest looks! The trees are breaking with
      the weight of their fruit. The vines are full of promise."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,5,GRIMM. It is a fruitful year.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,6,"CHARLES. Do you think so? Then at least one toil in the world will be
      repaid. One? Yet in the night a hailstorm may come and destroy it all."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,7,"SCHWARZ. That is very possible. It all may be destroyed an hour before the
      reaping."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,8,"CHARLES. Just what I say. All will be destroyed. Why should man prosper in
      that which he has in common with the ant, while he fails in that which
      places him on a level with the gods. Or is this the aim and limit of his
      destiny?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,9,SCHWARZ. I know not.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,10,"CHARLES. Thou hast said well; and wilt have done better, if thou never
      seekest to know. Brother, I have looked on men, their insect cares and
      their giant projects,�their god-like plans and mouse-like
      occupations, their intensely eager race after happiness�one trusting
      to the fleetness of his horse,�another to the nose of his ass,�a
      third to his own legs; this checkered lottery of life, in which so many
      stake their innocence and their leaven to snatch a prize, and,�blanks
      are all they draw�for they find, too late, that there was no prize
      in the wheel. It is a drama, brother, enough to bring tears into your
      eyes, while it shakes your sides with laughter."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,11,SCHWARZ. How gloriously the sun is setting yonder!
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,12,CHARLES (absorbed in the scene). So dies a hero! Worthy of adoration!
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,13,SCHWARZ. You seem deeply moved.

ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,18,GRIMM. By all the devils! What ails him? Is he ill?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,19,"CHARLES. There was a time when I could not have slept had I forgotten my
      evening prayers."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,20,"GRIMM. Are you beside yourself? Would you let the remembrances of your
      boyish years school you now?"

ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,22,GRIMM. Come! Don't play the child�I pray you
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,23,CHARLES. Oh that I were-that I were again a child!

      are so happy, all so united in brotherly love, by the spirit of peace! The
      whole world one family, and one Father above�but He not my father! I
      alone the outcast, I alone rejected from the ranks of the blessed�the

      vipers� riveted to vice with iron fetters�whirling headlong on
      the frail reed of sin to the gulf of perdition�amid the blooming
      flowers of a glad world, a howling Abaddon!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,33,SCHWARZ (to the others). How strange! I never saw him thus before.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,34,"CHARLES (with melancholy). Oh, that I might return again to my mother's
      womb. That I might be born a beggar! I should desire no more,�no
      more, oh heaven!�but that I might be like one of those poor
      laborers! Oh, I would toil till the blood streamed down my temples�to
      buy myself the luxury of one guiltless slumber�the blessedness of a
      single tear."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,35,"GRIMM (to the others). A little patience�the paroxysm is nearly
      over."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,36,"CHARLES. There was a time when my tears flowed so freely. Oh, those days
      of peace! Dear home of my fathers�ye verdant halcyon vales! O all ye
      Elysian scenes of my childhood!�will you never return?�will
      your delicious breezes never cool my burning bosom? Mourn with me, Nature,
      mourn! They will never return! never will their delicious breezes cool my
      burning bosom! They are gone! gone! irrevocably gone!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,37,Enter SCHWEITZER with water in his hat.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,38,"SCHWEITZER (offering him water in his hat). Drink, captain; here is plenty
      of water, and cold as ice."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,39,SCHWARZ. You are bleeding! What have you been doing?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,40,"SCHWEITZER. A bit of a freak, you fool, which had well-nigh cost me two
      legs and a neck. As I was frolicking along the steep sandbanks of the
      river, plump, in a moment, the whole concern slid from under me, and I
      after it, some ten fathoms deep;�there I lay, and, as I was
      recovering my five senses, lo and behold, the most sparkling water in the
      gravel! Not so much amiss this time, said I to myself, for the caper I
      have cut. The captain will be sure to relish a drink."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,41,"CHARLES (returns him the hat and wipes his face). But you are covered with
      mud, Schweitzer, and we can't see the scar which the Bohemian horseman
      marked on your forehead�your water was good, Schweitzer�and
      those scars become you well."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,42,SCHWEITZER. Bah! There's room for a score or two more yet.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,43,"CHARLES. Yes, boys�it was a hot day's work�and only one man
      lost. Poor Roller! he died a noble death. A marble monument would be
      erected to his memory had he died in any other cause than mine. Let this
      suffice. (He wipes the tears from his eyes.) How many, did you say, of the
      enemy were left on the field?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,44,"SCHWEITZER. A hundred and sixty huzzars, ninety-three dragoons, some forty
      chasseurs�in all about three hundred."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,45,"CHARLES. Three hundred for one! Every one of you has a claim upon this

ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,50,SCHWARZ. Take heed! Who goes there?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,51,"KOSINSKY. Pardon, sirs. I know not whether I am going right or wrong."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,52,"CHARLES. Suppose right, whom do you take us to be?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,53,KOSINSKY. Men!
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,54,"SCHWEITZER. I wonder, captain, whether we have given any proof of that?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,55,"KOSINSKY. I am in search of men who can look death in the face, and let
      danger play around then like a tamed snake; who prize liberty above life
      or honor; whose very names, hailed by the poor and the oppressed, appal
      the boldest, and make tyrants tremble."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,56,"SCHWEITZER (to the Captain). I like that fellow. Hark ye, friend! You have
      found your men."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,57,"KOSINSKY. So I should think, and I hope soon to find them brothers. You
      can direct me to the man I am looking for. 'Tis your captain, the great
      Count von Moor."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,58,"SCHWEITZER (taking him warmly by the hand). There's a good lad. You and I

ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,60,"KOSINSKY. Thou art he!�in those features�that air�who
      can look at thee, and doubt it? (Looks earnestly at him for some time). I
      have always wished to see the man with the annihilating look, as he sat on
      the ruins of Carthage.* That wish is realized."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,61,*[Alluding to Caius Marius. See Plutarch's Lives.]
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,62,SCHWEITZER. A mettlesome fellow!�
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,63,CHARLES. And what brings you to me?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,64,"KOSINSKY. Oh, captain! my more than cruel fate. I have suffered
      shipwrecked on the stormy ocean of the world; I have seen all my fondest
      hopes perish; and nought remains to me but a remembrance of the bitter
      past, which would drive me to madness, were I not to drown it by directing
      my energies to new objects."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,65,CHARLES. Another arraignment of the ways of Providence! Proceed.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,66,"KOSINSKY. I became a soldier. Misfortune still followed me in the army. I
      made a venture to the Indies, and my ship was shivered on the rocks�nothing
      but frustrated hopes! At last, I heard tell far and wide of your valiant
      deeds, incendiarisms, as they called them, and I came straightway hither,
      a distance of thirty leagues, firmly resolved to serve under you, if you
      will deign to accept my services. I entreat thee, noble captain, refuse me
      not!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,67,"SCHWEITZER (with a leap into the air). Hurrah! Hurrah! Our Roller replaced

ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,68,CHARLES. What is your name?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,69,KOSINSKY. Kosinsky.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,70,"CHARLES. What? Kosinsky! And do you know that you are but a thoughtless
      boy, and are embarking on the most weighty passage of your life as
      heedlessly as a giddy girl? You will find no playing at bowls or ninepins
      here, as you probably imagine."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,71,"KOSINSKY. I understand you, sir. I am,'tis true, but four-and-twenty years
      old, but I have seen swords glittering, and have heard balls whistling
      around me."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,72,"CHARLES. Indeed, young gentleman? And was it for this that you took
      fencing lessons, to run poor travellers through the body for the sake of a
      dollar, or stab women in the back? Go! go! You have played truant to your
      nurse because she shook the rod at you."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,73,"SCHWEITZER. Why, what the devil, captain! what are you about? Do you mean
      to turn away such a Hercules? Does he not look as if he could baste
      Marechal Saxe across the Ganges with a ladle?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,74,"CHARLES. Because your silly schemes miscarry, you come here to turn rogue
      and assassin! Murder, boy, do you know the meaning of that word? You may
      have slumbered in peace after cropping a few poppy-heads, but to have a
      murder on your soul�"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,75,KOSINSKY. All the murders you bid me commit be upon my head!
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,76,"CHARLES. What! Are you so nimble-witted? Do you take measure of a man to
      catch him by flattery? How do you know that I am not haunted by terrific
      dreams, or that I shall not tremble on my death-bed?�How much have
      you already done of which you have considered the responsibility?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,77,"KOSINSKY. Very little, I must confess; excepting this long journey to you,
      noble count�"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,78,"CHARLES. Has your tutor let the story of Robin Hood�get into your
      hands? Such careless rascals ought to be sent to the galleys. And has it
      heated your childish fancy, and infected you with the mania of becoming a
      hero? Are you thirsting for honor and fame? Would you buy immortality by
      deeds of incendiarism? Mark me, ambitious youth! No laurel blooms for the
      incendiary. No triumph awaits the victories of the bandit�nothing
      but curses, danger, death, disgrace. Do you see the gibbet yonder on the
      hill?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,79,"SPIEGEL (going up and down indignantly). Oh, how stupid! How abominably,
      unpardonably stupid! That's not the way. I went to work in a very
      different manner."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,80,"KOSINSKY. What should he fear, who fears not death?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,81,"CHARLES. Bravo! Capital! You have made good use of your time at school;
      you have got your Seneca cleverly by heart. But, my good friend, you will
      not be able with these fine phrases to cajole nature in the hour of
      suffering; they will never blunt the biting tooth of remorse. Ponder on it
      well, my son! (Takes him by the hand.) I advise you as a father. First
      learn the depth of the abyss before you plunge headlong into it. If in
      this world you can catch a single glimpse of happiness�moments may
      come when you-awake,�and then�it may be too late. Here you
      step out as it were beyond the pale of humanity�you must either be
      more than human or a demon. Once more, my son! if but a single spark of
      hope glimmer for you elsewhere, fly this fearful compact, where nought but
      despair enters, unless a higher wisdom has so ordained it. You may deceive
      yourself�believe me, it is possible to mistake that for strength of
      mind which in reality is nothing more than despair. Take my counsel! mine!
      and depart quickly."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,82,"KOSINSKY. No! I will not stir. If my entreaties fail to move you, hear but
      the story of my misfortunes. And then you will force the dagger into my
      hand as eagerly as you now seek to withhold it. Seat yourselves awhile on
      the grass and listen."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,83,CHARLES. I will hear your story.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,84,"KOSINSKY. Know, then, that I am a Bohemian nobleman. By the early death of
      my father I became master of large possessions. The scene of my domain was
      a paradise; for it contained an angel�a maid adorned with all the
      charms of blooming youth, and chaste as the light of heaven. But to whom
      do I talk of this? It falls unheeded on your cars�ye never loved, ye
      were never beloved�"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,85,"SCHWEITZER. Gently, gently! The captain grows red as fire."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,86,"CHARLES. No more! I'll hear you some other time�to-morrow,�or
      by-and-by, or�after I have seen blood."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,87,"KOSINSKY. Blood, blood! Only hear on! Blood will fill your whole soul. She
      was of citizen birth, a German�but her look dissolved all the
      prejudices of aristocracy. With blushing modesty she received the bridal
      ring from my hand, and on the morrow I was to have led my AMELIA to the
      altar. (CHARLES rises suddenly.) In the midst of my intoxicating dream of
      happiness, and while our nuptials were preparing, an express summoned me
      to court. I obeyed the summons. Letters were shown me which I was said to
      have written, full of treasonable matter. I grew scarlet with indignation
      at such malice; they deprived me of my sword, thrust me into prison, and
      all my senses forsook me."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,88,SCHWEITZER. And in the meantime�go on! I already scent the game.
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,89,"KOSINSKY. There I lay a whole month, and knew not what was taking place. I
      was full of anxiety for my Amelia, who I was sure would suffer the pangs
      of death every moment in apprehension of my fate. At last the prime
      minister makes his appearance,�congratulates me in honey-sweet words
      on the establishment of my innocence,�reads to me a warrant of
      discharge,�and returns me my sword. I flew in triumph to my castle,
      to the arms of my Amelia, but she had disappeared! She had been carried
      off, it was said, at midnight, no one knew whither, and no eye had beheld
      her since. A suspicion instantly flashed across my mind. I rushed to the
      capital�I made inquiries at court�all eyes were upon me,�no
      one would give me information. At last I discovered her through a grated
      window of the palace�she threw me a small billet."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,90,SCHWEITZER. Did I not say so?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,91,"KOSINSKY. Death and destruction! The contents were these! They had given
      her the choice between seeing me put to death, and becoming the mistress
      of the prince. In the struggle between honor and love she chose the
      latter, and (with a bitter smile) I was saved."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,92,SCHWEITZER. And what did you do then?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,93,"KOSINSKY. Then I stood like one transfixed with a thunderbolt! Blood was
      my first thought, blood my last! Foaming at the mouth, I ran to my
      quarters, armed myself with a two-edged sword, and, with all haste, rushed
      to the minister's house, for he�he alone�had been the fiendish
      pander. They must have observed me in the street, for, as I went up, I
      found all the doors fastened. I searched, I enquired. He was gone, they
      said, to the prince. I went straight thither, but nobody there would know
      anything about him. I return, force the doors, find the base wretch, and
      was on the point when five or six servants suddenly rushed on me from
      behind, and wrenched the weapon from my hands."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,94,"SCHWEITZER (stamping the ground). And so the fellow got off clear, and you
      lost your labor?"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,95,"KOSINSKY. I was arrested, accused, criminally prosecuted, degraded, and�mark
      this�transported beyond the frontier, as a special favor. My estates
      were confiscated to the minister, and Amelia remained in the clutches of
      the tiger, where she weeps and mourns away her life, while my vengeance
      must keep a fast, and crouch submissively to the yoke of despotism."
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,96,"SCHWEITZER (rising and whetting his sword). That is grist to our mill,
      captain! There is something here for the incendiaries!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,97,"CHARLES (who has been walking up and down in violent agitation, with a
      sudden start to the ROBBERS). I must see her. Up! collect your baggage�you'll
      stay with us, Kosinsky! Quick, pack up!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,98,THE ROBBERS. Where to? What?
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,99,"CHARLES. Where to? Who asks that question? (Fiercely to SCHWEITZER)
      Traitor, wouldst thou keep me back? But by the hope for heaven!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,100,"SCHWEITZER. I, a traitor? Lead on to hell and I will follow you!"
ACT III.,SCENE II.�Country near the Danube.,101,"CHARLES (falling on his neck). Dear brother! thou shalt follow me. She
weeps, she mourns away her life. Up! quickly! all of you! to

across to the castle.) Not to behold her! not even one look?�and only

      heels. Methinks I should know him! There is something so lofty, so
      familiar, in his wild, sunburnt features, which makes me tremble. Amelia,
      too, is not indifferent towards him! Does she not dart eager, languishing
      looks at the fellow looks of which she is so chary to all the world
      beside? Did I not see her drop those stealthy tears into the wine, which,
      behind my back, he quaffed so eagerly that he seemed to swallow the very
      glass? Yes, I saw it�I saw it in the mirror with my own eyes. Take

      it for this that I have sacrificed my nights�that I have mowed down
      mountains and filled up chasms? For this that I have turned rebel against
      all the instincts of humanity? To have this vagabond outcast blunder in at

      matters all depends upon one's view of a thing; and he is a fool who takes
      any view that is contrary to his own interest. A father quaffs perhaps a
      bottle of wine more than ordinary�he is in a certain mood�the
      result is a human being, the last thing that was thought of in the affair.
      Well, I, too, am in a certain mood,�and the result is that a human
      being perishes; and surely there is more of reason and purpose in this
      than there was in his production. If the birth of a man is the result of
      an animal paroxysm, who should take it into his head to attach any
      importance to the negation of his birth? A curse upon the folly of our
      nurses and teachers, who fill our imaginations with frightful tales, and
      impress fearful images of punishment upon the plastic brain of childhood,
      so that involuntary shudders shake the limbs of the man with icy fear,
      arrest his boldest resolutions, and chain his awakening reason in the
      fetters of superstitious darkness. Murder! What a hell full of furies
      hovers around that word. Yet 'tis no more than if nature forgets to bring
      forth one man more or the doctor makes a mistake�and thus the whole
      phantasmagoria vanishes. It was something, and it is nothing. Does not
      this amount to exactly the same thing as though it had been nothing, and
      came to nothing; and about nothing it is hardly worth while to waste a
      word. Man is made of filth, and for a time wades in filth, and produces
      filth, and sinks back into filth, till at last he fouls the boots of his
      own posterity.*"

      joy�what a stupid blockhead was I that I did not at a glance�oh,

      put me into�I always loved you so dearly; and what misery you might
      have brought upon me. You were sitting in my lap�do you remember?

      on me! what business had I, thoughtless old fool, to leave you alone�and
      how I felt as if I were in a boiling caldron when I heard you screaming in
      the passage; and, when I rushed in, there was your red blood gushing
      forth, and you lying on the ground. Oh, by the Blessed Virgin! did I not
      feel as if a bucket of icy cold water was emptied all over me?�but
      so it happens, unless one keeps all one's eyes upon children. Good Heaven!
      if it had gone into your eye! Unfortunately it happened to be the right

      so fond of you. And do you recollect what you said to me down in the
      stable, when I put you upon old master's hunter, and let you scamper round
      the great meadow? ""Daniel!"" said you, ""only wait till I am grown a big

        To rob, to kill, to wench, to fight,
         Our pastime is, and daily sport;
        The gibbet claims us morn and night,
         So let's be jolly, time is short.

        A merry life we lead, and free,
         A life of endless fun;
        Our couch is 'neath the greenwood tree,
        Through wind and storm we gain our fee,
         The moon we make our sun.
        Old Mercury is our patron true,
        And a capital chap for helping us through.

        To-day we make the abbot our host,
         The farmer rich to-morrow;
        And where we shall get our next day's roast,
         Gives us nor care nor sorrow.

        And, when with Rhenish and rare Moselle
         Our throats we have been oiling,
        Our courage burns with a fiercer swell,
        And we're hand and glove with the Lord of Hell,
         Who down in his flames is broiling.

        For fathers slain the orphans' cries,
         The widowed mothers' moan and wail,
        Of brides bereaved the whimpering sighs,
         Like music sweet, our ears regale.

        Beneath the axe to see them writhe,
         Bellow like calves, fall dead like flies;
        Such bonny sights, and sounds so blithe,
         With rapture fill our ears and eyes.

        And when at last our death-knell rings�
         The devil take that hour!
        Payment in full the hangman brings,
         And off the stage we scour.

        Then hip! hip! hip! and away we go!"

      to shame."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,9,"SCHWEITZER. Then you are out, by old Harry! He did not part from us like
      one that had any masterpiece of roguery in view. Have you forgotten what
      he said as he marched us across the heath? ""The fellow that takes so much
      as a turnip out of a field, if I know it, leaves his head behind him, as
      true as my name is Moor."" We dare not plunder."

ACT IV.,SCENE V.,14,"SPIEGEL. Hush! I tell you; hush! He has got his eavesdroppers all around

      this that we stake our lives�that we endure all the splenetic
      caprices of fortunes�that we may in the end congratulate ourselves
      upon being the serfs of a slave? Serfs! When we might be princes? By
      heaven! Razmann, I could never brook it."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,15,"SCHWEITZER (overhearing him�to the others). Yes�there's a hero
      for you! He is just the man to do mighty execution upon frogs with stones.

      the eye of a needle."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,16,"SPIEGEL. (to RAZMANN). Yes�and for years I have been intent upon it.
      There must be an alteration, Razmann. If you are the man I always took you
      for�Razmann! He is missing�he is almost given up�Razmann�
      methinks his hour is come. What? does not the color so much as mount to
      your cheek when you hear the chimes of liberty ringing in your ears? Have
      you not courage enough to take the hint?"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,17,RAZ. Ha! Satan! What bait art thou spreading for my soul?
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,18,"SPIEGEL. Does it take? Good! then follow me! I have marked in what

      to draw him of.)"

      You remind me, at the right moment, of the Bohemian forest! Were not you
      the coward that began to quail when the cry arose, ""the enemy is coming!""
      I then swore by my soul�(They fight, SPIEGELBERG is killed.) To the
      devil with thee, assassin!"

      my comrades! Don't let such a trifle disturb you. The brute has always
      been inveterate against the captain and has not a single scar on his whole
      body. Once more, be still. Ha, the scoundrel! He would stab a man behind
      his back�skulk and murder! Is it for this that the hot sweat has
      poured down us in streams? that we may sneak out of the world at last like
      contemptible wretches? The brute! Is it for this that we have lived in
      fire and brimstone? To perish at last like rats?"

      this sword be consecrated to the dark goddess of retribution! That was not

      must nurse up my strength again. Leave me!"

      song of the old Roman, that my slumbering genius may wake up again. Hand
      me my lute. Midnight, say you?"

ACT IV.,SCENE V.,76,"CHARLES. Locks, bolts, and bars, away! It must come out. Now, for the
      first time, come to my aid, thief-craft! (He opens the grated iron door
      with, housebreaking tools. An OLD MAN, reduced to a skeleton, comes up
      from below.)"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,77,THE OLD MAN. Mercy on a poor wretch! Mercy!
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,78,CHARLES (starts back in terror). That is my father's voice!
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,79,"OLD MOOR. I thank thee, merciful Heaven! The hour of deliverance has
      arrived."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,80,"CHARLES. Shade of the aged Moor! what has disturbed thee in thy grave? Has
      thy soul left this earth charged with some foul crime that bars the gates
      of Paradise against thee? Say?�I will have masses read, to send thy
      wandering spirit to its home. Hast thou buried in the earth the gold of
      widows and orphans, that thou art driven to wander howling through the
      midnight hour? I will snatch the hidden treasure from the clutches of the
      infernal dragon, though he should vomit a thousand redhot flames upon me,
      and gnash his sharp teeth against my sword. Or comest thou, at my request,
      to reveal to me the mysteries of eternity? Speak, thou! speak! I am not
      the man to blanch with fear!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,81,"OLD MOOR. I am not a spirit. Touch me�I live but oh! a life indeed
      of misery!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,82,CHARLES. What! hast thou not been buried?
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,83,"OLD MOOR. I was buried�that is to say, a dead dog lies in the vault
      of my ancestors, and I have been pining for three long moons in this dark
      and loathsome dungeon, where no sunbeam shines, no warm breeze penetrates,
      where no friend is seen, where the hoarse raven croaks and owls screech
      their midnight concert."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,84,CHARLES. Heaven and earth! Who has done this?
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,85,"OLD MOOR. Curse him not! 'Tis my son, Francis, who did this."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,86,"CHARLES. Francis? Francis? Oh, eternal chaos!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,87,"OLD MOOR. If thou art a man, and hast a human heart�oh! my unknown
      deliverer�then listen to a father's miseries which his own sons have
      heaped upon him. For three long moons I have moaned my pitiful tale to
      these flinty walls�but all my answer was an empty echo, that seemed
      to mock my wailings. Therefore, if thou art a man, and hast a human heart�"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,88,CHARLES. That appeal might move even wild beasts to pity.
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,89,"OLD MOOR. I lay upon a sick bed, and had scarcely begun to recover a
      little strength, after a dangerous illness, when a man was brought to me,
      who pretended that my first-born had fallen in battle. He brought a sword
      stained with his blood, and his last farewell�and said that my curse
      had driven him into battle, and death, and despair."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,90,CHARLES (turning away in violent agitation). The light breaks in upon me!
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,91,"OLD MOOR. Hear me on! I fainted at the dreadful news. They must have
      thought me dead; for, when I recovered my senses, I was already in my
      coffin, shrouded like a corpse. I scratched against the lid. It was opened�'twas
      in the dead of night�my son Francis stood before me� ""What!""
      said he, with a tremendous voice, ""wilt thou then live forever?"" �and
      with this he slammed-to the lid of the coffin. The thunder of these words
      bereft me of my senses; when I awoke again, I felt that the coffin was in
      motion, and being borne on wheels. At last it was opened �I found
      myself at the entrance of this dungeon�my son stood before me, and
      the man, too, who had brought me the bloody sword from Charles. I fell at
      my son's feet, and ten times I embraced his knees, and wept, and conjured,
      and supplicated, but the supplications of a father reached not his flinty
      heart. ""Down with the old carcass!"" said he, with a voice of thunder, ""he
      has lived too long;""�and I was thrust down without mercy, and my son
      Francis closed the door upon Me."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,92,CHARLES. Impossible!�impossible! Your memory or senses deceive you.
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,93,"OLD MOOR. Oh, that it were so! But hear me on, and restrain your rage!
      There I lay for twenty hours, and not a soul cared for my misery. No human
      footstep treads this solitary wild, for 'tis commonly believed that the
      ghosts of my ancestors drag clanking chains through these ruins, and chant
      their funeral dirge at the hour of midnight. At last I heard the door
      creak again on its hinges; this man opened it, and brought me bread and
      water. He told me that I had been condemned to die of hunger, and that his
      life was in danger should it be discovered that he fed me. Thus has my
      miserable existence been till now sustained�but the unceasing cold�the
      foul air of my filthy dungeon�my incurable grief�have
      exhausted my strength, and reduced my body to a skeleton. A thousand times
      have I implored heaven, with tears, to put an end to my sufferings�but
      doubtless the measure of my punishment is not fulfilled,�or some
      happiness must be yet in store for me, for which he deigns thus
      miraculously to preserve me. But I suffer justly�my Charles! my
      Charles!�and before there was even a gray hair on his Head!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,94,"CHARLES. Enough! Rise! ye stocks, ye lumps of ice! ye lazy unfeeling
      sleepers! Up! will none of you awake? (He fires a pistol over their
      heads.)"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,95,THE ROBBERS (starting up). Ho! hallo! hallo! what is the matter?
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,96,"CHARLES. Has not that tale shaken you out of your sleep? 'Tis enough to
      break the sleep eternal! See here, see here! The laws of the world have
      become mere dice-play; the bonds of nature are burst asunder; the Demon of
      Discord has broken loose, and stalks abroad triumphant! the Son has slain
      his Father!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,97,THE ROBBERS. What does the captain say?
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,98,"CHARLES. Slain! did I say? No, that is too mild a term! A son has a
      thousand-fold broken his own father on the wheel,�impaled, racked,
      flayed him alive!�but all these words are too feeble to express what
      would make sin itself blush and cannibals shudder. For ages, no devil ever
      conceived a deed so horrible. His own father!�but see, see him! he
      has fainted away! His own father�the son�into this dungeon�cold�
      naked�hungry�athirst�Oh! see, I pray you, see!�'tis
      my own father, in very truth it is."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,99,THE ROBBERS (come running and surround the old man). Your father? Yours?
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,100,"SCHWEITZER (approaches him reverently, and falls on his knees before him).
      Father of my captain! let me kiss thy feet! My dagger is at thy command."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,101,"CHARLES. Revenge, revenge, revenge! thou horribly injured, profaned old
      man! Thus, from this moment, and forever, I rend in twain all ties of
      fraternity. (He rends his garment from top to bottom.) Here, in the face
      of heaven, I curse him�curse every drop of blood which flows in his
      veins! Hear me, O moon and stars! and thou black canopy of night, that
      lookest down upon this horror! Hear me, thrice terrible avenger. Thou who
      reignest above yon pallid orb, who sittest an avenger and a judge above
      the stars, and dartest thy fiery bolts through darkness on the head of
      guilt! Behold me on my knees behold me raise this hand aloft in the gloom
      of night�and hear my oath�and may nature vomit me forth as
      some horrible abortion from out the circle of her works if I break that
      oath! Here I swear that I will never more greet the light of day, till the
      blood of that foul parricide, spilt upon this stone, reeks in misty vapor
      towards heaven. (He rises.)"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,102,"ROBBERS. 'Tis a deed of hell! After this, who shall call us villains? No!
      by all the dragons of darkness we never have done anything half so
      horrible."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,103,"CHARLES. True! and by all the fearful groans of those whom your daggers
      have despatched�of those who on that terrible day were consumed by
      fire, or crushed by the falling tower�no thought of murder or rapine
      shall be harbored in your breast, till every man among you has dyed his
      garments scarlet in this monster's blood. It never, I should think,
      entered your dreams, that it would fall to your lot to execute the great
      decrees of heaven? The tangled web of our destiny is unravelled! To-day,
      to-day, an invisible power has ennobled our craft! Worship Him who has
      called you to this high destiny, who has conducted you hither, and deemed
      ye worthy to be the terrible angels of his inscrutable judgments! Uncover
      your heads! Bow down and kiss the dust, and rise up sanctified. (They
      kneel.)"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,104,"SCHWEITZER. Now, captain, issue your commands! What shall we do?"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,105,"CHARLES. Rise, Schweitzer! and touch these sacred locks! (Leading him to
      his father, and putting a lock of hair in his hand.) Do you remember
      still, how you, cleft the skull of that Bohemian trooper, at the moment
      his sabre was descending on my head, and I had sunk down on my knees,
      breathless and exhausted? 'Twas then I promised thee a reward that should
      be right royal. But to this hour I have never been able to discharge that
      debt."
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,106,"SCHWEITZER. You swore that much to me, 'tis true; but let me call you my
      debtor forever!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,107,"CHARLES. No; now will I repay thee, Schweitzer! No mortal has yet been
      honored as thou shalt be. I appoint thee avenger of my father's wrongs!
      (SCHWEITZER rises.)"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,108,"SCHWEITZER. Mighty captain! this day you have, for the first time, made me
      truly proud! Say, when, where, how shall I smite him?"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,109,"CHARLES. The minutes are sacred. You must hasten to the work. Choose the
      best of the band, and lead them straight to the count's castle! Drag him
      from his bed, though he sleep, or he folded in the arms of pleasure! Drag
      him from the table, though he be drunk! Tear him from the crucifix, though
      he lie on his knees before it! But mark my words� I charge thee,
      deliver him into my hands alive! I will hew that man to pieces, and feed
      the hungry vultures with his flesh, who dares but graze his skin, or
      injure a single hair of his head! I must have him whole. Bring him to me
      whole and alive, and a million shall be thy reward. I'll plunder kings at
      the risk of my life, but thou shalt have it, and go free as air. Thou hast
      my purpose�see it done!"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,110,"SCHWEITZER. Enough, captain! here is my hand upon it. You shall see both
      of us, or neither. Come, Schweitzer's destroying angels, follow me! (Exit
      with a troop.)"
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,111,CHARLES. The rest of you disperse in the forest�I remain here.
ACT IV.,SCENE V.,112,
ACT V.,SCENE V.,1,"Enter DANIEL, with a lantern and a bundle."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,2,"DANIEL. Farewell, dear home! How many happy days have I enjoyed within
      these walls, while my old master lived. Tears to thy memory, thou whom the
      grave has long since devoured! He deserves this tribute from an old
      servant. His roof was the asylum of orphans, the refuge of the destitute,
      but this son has made it a den of murderers. Farewell, thou dear floor!
      How often has old Daniel scrubbed thee! Farewell, dear stove, old Daniel
      takes a heavy leave of thee. All things had grown so familiar to thee,�thou
      wilt feel it sorely, old Eleazar. But heaven preserve me through grace
      from the wiles and assault of the tempter. Empty I came hither�empty
      I will depart,�but my soul is saved! (He is in the act of going out,
      when he is met by FRANCIS, rushing in, in his dressing-gown.) Heaven help
      me! Master! (He puts out his lantern.)"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,3,"FRANCIS. Betrayed! betrayed! The spirit of the dead are vomited from their
      graves. The realm of death, shaken out of its eternal slumber, roars at
      me, ""Murderer, murderer!"" Who moves there?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,4,"DANIEL (frightened). Help, holy Virgin! help! Is it you, my gracious
      master, whose shrieks echo so terribly through the castle that every one
      is aroused out of his sleep?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,5,"FRANCIS. Sleep? And who gave thee leave to sleep? Go, get lights! (Exit
      DANIEL. Enter another servant.) No one shall sleep at this hour. Do you
      hear? All shall be awake�in arms�let the guns be loaded! Did
      you not see them rushing through yon vaulted passages?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,6,"SERVANT. See whom, my lord?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,7,"FRANCIS. Whom? you dolt, slave! And do you, with a cold and vacant stare,
      ask me whom? Have they not beset me almost to madness? Whom? blockhead!
      whom? Ghosts and demons! How far is the night advanced?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,8,SERVANT. The watch has just called two.
ACT V.,SCENE V.,9,"FRANCIS. What? will this eternal night last till doomsday? Did you hear no
      tumult near? no shout of victory? no trampling of horses? Where is Char�the
      Count, I would say?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,10,"SERVANT. I know not, my lord."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,11,"FRANCIS. You know not? And are you too one of his gang? I'll tread your
      villain's heart out through your ribs for that infernal ""I know not!""
      Begone, fetch the minister!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,12,SERVANT. My lord!
ACT V.,SCENE V.,13,"FRANCIS. What! Do you grumble? Do you demur? (Exit servant hastily.) Do my
      very slaves conspire against me? Heaven, earth, and hell�all
      conspire against me!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,14,DANIEL (returns with a lighted candle). My lord!
ACT V.,SCENE V.,15,"FRANCIS. Who said I trembled? No!�'twas but a dream. The dead still
      rest in their graves! Tremble! or pale? No, no! I am calm�quite
      tranquil."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,16,"DANIEL. You are as pale as death, my lord; your voice is weak and
      faltering."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,17,"FRANCIS. I am somewhat feverish. When the minister comes be sure you say I
      am in a fever. Say that I intend to be bled in the morning."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,18,DANIEL. Shall I give you some drops of the balsam of life on sugar?
ACT V.,SCENE V.,19,"FRANCIS. Yes, balsam of life on sugar! The minister will not be here just
      yet. My voice is weak and faltering. Give me of the balsam of life on
      sugar!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,20,"DANIEL. Let me have the keys, I will go down to the closet and get it."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,21,"FRANCIS. No! no! no! Stay!�or I will go with you. You see I must not
      be left alone! How easily I might, you see�faint�if I should
      be left alone. Never mind, never mind! It will pass off�you must not
      leave me."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,22,"DANIEL. Indeed, Sir, you are ill, very ill."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,23,"FRANCIS. Yes, just so, just so, nothing more. And illness, you know,
      bewilders the brain, and breeds strange and maddening dreams. What signify
      dreams? Dreams come from the stomach and cannot signify anything. Is it
      not so, Daniel? I had a very comical dream just now. (He sinks down
      fainting.)"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,24,"DANIEL. Oh, merciful heaven! what is this? George!�Conrad!
      Sebastian! Martin! Give but some sign of life! (Shaking him.) Oh, the
      Blessed Virgin! Oh, Joseph! Keep but your reason! They will say I have
      murdered him! Lord have mercy upon me!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,25,"FRANCIS (confused). Avaunt!�avaunt!�why dost thou glare upon
      me thus, thou horrible spectre? The time for the resurrection of the dead
      is not yet come."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,26,DANIEL. Merciful heavens! he has lost his senses.
ACT V.,SCENE V.,27,"FRANCIS (recovering himself gradually). Where am I? You here, Daniel? What
      have I said? Heed it not. I have told a lie, whatever I said. Come, help
      me up! 'T was only a fit of delirium�because�because�I
      have not finished my night's rest."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,28,"DANIEL. If John were but here! I'll call for help�I'll send for the
      physician."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,29,"FRANCIS. Stay! Seat yourself by my side on this sofa! There. You are a
      sensible man, a good man. Listen to my dream!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,30,"DANIEL. Not now; another time! Let me lead you to bed; you have great need
      of rest."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,31,"FRANCIS. No, no; I prythee, listen, Daniel, and have a good laugh at me.
      You must know I fancied that I held a princely banquet, my heart was
      merry, and I lay stretched on the turf in the castle garden; and all on a
      sudden�it was at midday�and all on a sudden�but mind you
      have a good laugh at me!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,32,DANIEL. All on a sudden.
ACT V.,SCENE V.,33,"FRANCIS. All on a sudden a tremendous peal of thunder struck upon my
      slumbering ear; I started up staggering and trembling; and lo, it seemed
      as if the whole hemisphere had burst forth in one flaming sheet of fire,
      and mountains, and cities, and forests melted away like wax in the
      furnace; and then rose a howling whirlwind, which swept before it the
      earth, and the sea, and heaven; then came a sound, as from brazen
      trumpets, ""Earth, give up thy dead: sea, give up thy dead!"" and the open
      plains began to heave, and to cast up skulls, and ribs, and jawbones, and
      legs, which drew together into human bodies, and then came sweeping along
      in dense, interminable masses�a living deluge. Then I looked up, and
      lo! I stood at the foot of the thundering Sinai, and above me was a
      multitude, and below me a multitude; and on the summit of the mountain, on
      three smoking thrones, sat three men, before whose gaze all creation
      trembled."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,34,"DANIEL. Why, this is a living picture of the day of judgment."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,35,"FRANCIS. Did I not tell you? Is it not ridiculous stuff? And one stepped
      forth who, to look upon, was like a starlight night; he had in his hand a
      signet ring of iron, which he held up between the east and the west, and
      said, ""Eternal, holy, just, immutable! There is but one truth; there is
      but one virtue! Woe, woe, woe! to the doubting sinner!"" Then stepped forth
      a second, who had in his hand a flashing mirror, which he held up between
      the east and west, and said, ""This is the mirror of truth; hypocrisy and
      deceit cannot look on it."" Then was I terrified, and so were all, for we
      saw the forms of snakes, and tigers, and leopards reflected from that
      fearful mirror. Then stepped forth a third, who had in his hand a brazen
      balance, which he held up between the east and the west, and said,
      ""Approach, ye sons of Adam! I weigh your thoughts in the balance of my
      wrath! and your deeds with the weight of my fury!"""
ACT V.,SCENE V.,36,DANIEL. The Lord have mercy upon me!
ACT V.,SCENE V.,37,"FRANCIS. They all stood pale and trembling, and every heart was panting
      with fearful expectation. Then it seemed to me as if I heard my name
      called the first from out the thunders of the mountain, and the innermost
      marrow froze within my bones, and my teeth chattered loudly. Presently the
      clang of the balance was heard, the rocks sent forth thunders, and the
      hours glided by, one after the other, towards the left scale, and each
      threw into it a mortal sin!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,38,"DANIEL. Oh, may God forgive you!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,39,"FRANCIS. He forgave me not! The left scale grew mountains high, but the
      other, filled with the blood of atonement, still outweighed it. At last
      came an old man, heavily bowed down with grief, his arm gnawed through
      with raging hunger. Every eye turned away in horror from the sight. I knew
      the man�he cut off a lock of his silver hair, and cast it into the
      scale of my sins, when to! in an instant, it sank down to the abyss, and
      the scale of atonement flew up on high. Then heard I a voice, issuing like
      thunder from the bowels *[Some editions of the original read Rauch
      (smoke), some Bauch, as translated.] of the mountain, ""Pardon, pardon to
      every sinner of the earth and of the deep! Thou alone art rejected!"" (A
      profound pause.) Well, why don't you laugh?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,40,DANIEL. Can I laugh while my flesh creeps? Dreams come from above.
ACT V.,SCENE V.,41,"FRANCIS. Pshaw! pshaw! Say not so! Call me a fool, an idiot, an absurd
      fool! Do, there's a good Daniel, I entreat of you; have a hearty laugh at
      me!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,42,DANIEL. Dreams come from God. I will pray for you.
ACT V.,SCENE V.,43,"FRANCIS. Thou liest, I tell thee. Go, this instant, run! be quick! see
      where the minister tarries all this time; tell him to come quickly,
      instantly! But, I tell thee, thou liest!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,44,"DANIEL. Heaven have mercy upon you!
                             [Exit.]"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,45,"FRANCIS. Vulgar prejudice! mere superstition! It has not yet been proved
      that the past is not past and forgotten, or that there is an eye above
      this earth to take account of what passes on it. Humph! Humph! But whence,
      then, this fearful whisper to my soul? Is there really an avenging judge
      above the stars? No, no! Yes, yes! A fearful monitor within bears witness
      that there is One above the stars who judgeth! What! meet the avenger
      above the stars this very night? No, no! I say. All is empty, lonely,
      desolate, beyond the stars. Miserable subterfuge, beneath which thy
      cowardice seeks to hide itself. And if there should be something in it
      after all? No! no! it cannot be. I insist that it cannot be! But yet, if
      there should be! Woe to thee if thy sins should all have been registered
      above!�if they should be counted over to thee this very night! Why
      creeps this shudder through my frame? To die! Why does that word frighten
      me thus? To give an account to the Avenger, there, above the stars! and if
      he should be just�the wails of orphans and widows, of the oppressed,
      the tormented, ascending to his ears, and he be just? Why have they been
      afflicted? And why have I been permitted to trample upon them?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,46,Enter PASTOR MOSER.
ACT V.,SCENE V.,47,"MOSER. Your lordship sent for me! I am surprised! The first time in my
      life! Is it to scoff at religion, or does it begin to make you tremble?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,48,"FRANCIS. I may scoff or I may tremble, according as you shall answer me.
      Listen to me, Moser, I will prove that you are a fool, or wish to make
      fools of others, and you shall answer me. Do you hear? At the peril of
      your life you shall answer me."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,49,"MOSER. 'Tis a higher Being whom you summon before your tribunal. He will
      answer you hereafter."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,50,"FRANCIS. I will be answered now, this instant, that I may not commit the
      contemptible folly of calling upon the idol of the vulgar under the
      pressure of suffering. I have often, in bumpers of Burgundy, tauntingly
      pledged you in the toast, ""There is no God!"" Now I address myself to you
      in earnest, and I tell you there is none? You shall oppose me with all the
      weapons in your power; but with the breath of my lips I will blow them
      away."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,51,"MOSER. 'Twere well that you could also blow away the thunder which will
      alight upon your proud soul with ten thousand times ten thousand tons'
      weight! That omniscient God, whom you�fool and miscreant�are
      denying in the midst of his creation, needeth not to justify himself by
      the mouth of dust. He is as great in your tyrannies as in the sweetest
      smile of triumphant virtue."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,52,"FRANCIS. Uncommonly well said, parson. Thus I like you."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,53,"MOSER. I stand here as steward of a greater Master, and am addressing one
      who, like myself, is a sinner�one whom I care not to please. I must
      indeed be able to work miracles, to extort the acknowledgment from your
      obdurate wickedness�but if your conviction is so firm, why have you
      sent for me in the middle of the night?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,54,"FRANCIS. Because time hangs heavy on my hands, and the chess-board has
      ceased to have any attraction. I wish to amuse myself in a tilt with the
      parson. Your empty terrors will not unman my courage. I am well aware that
      those who have come off short in this world look forward to eternity; but
      they will be sadly disappointed. I have always read that our whole body is
      nothing more than a blood-spring, and that, with its last drop, mind and
      thought dissolve into nothing. They share all the infirmities of the body;
      why, then, should they not cease with its dissolution? Why not evaporate
      in its decomposition? Let a drop of water stray into your brain, and life
      makes a sudden pause, which borders on non-existence, and this pause
      continued is death. Sensation is the vibration of a few chords, which,
      when the instrument is broken, cease to sound. If I raze my seven castles�if
      I dash this Venus to pieces�there is an end of their symmetry and
      beauty. Behold! thus is it with your immortal soul!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,55,"MOSER. So says the philosophy of your despair. But your own heart, which
      knocks against your ribs with terror even while you thus argue, gives your
      tongue the lie. These cobwebs of systems are swept away by the single word�""Thou
      must die!"" I challenge you, and be this the test: If you maintain your
      firmness in the hour of death; if your principles do not then miserably
      desert you, you shall be admitted to have the best of the argument. But
      if, in that dread hour, the least shudder creeps over you, then woe be to
      you! you have deceived yourself."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,56,FRANCIS (disturbed). If in the hour of death a shudder creeps over me?
ACT V.,SCENE V.,57,"MOSER. I have seen many such wretches before now, who set truth at
      defiance up to that point; but at the approach of death the illusion
      vanished. I will stand at your bedside when you are dying�I should
      much like to see a tyrant die. I will stand by, and look you steadfastly
      in the face when the physician takes your cold, clammy hand, and is
      scarcely able to detect your expiring pulse; and when he looks up, and,
      with a fearful shake of the head, says to you, ""All human aid is in vain!""
      Beware, at that moment, beware, lest you look like Richard and Nero!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,58,FRANCIS. No! no!
ACT V.,SCENE V.,59,"MOSER. Even that very ""No"" will then be turned to a howling ""Yea!"" An
      inward tribunal, which you can no longer cheat with sceptical delusions,
      will then wake up and pass judgment upon you. But the waking up will be
      like that of one buried alive in the bowels of the churchyard; there will
      come remorse like that of the suicide who has committed the fatal act and
      repents it;�'twill be a flash of lightning suddenly breaking in upon
      the midnight darkness of your life! There will be one look, and, if you
      can sustain that, I will admit that you have won!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,60,FRANCIS (walking up and down restlessly). Cant! Priestly cant!
ACT V.,SCENE V.,61,"MOSER. Then, for the first time, will the sword of eternity pass through
      your soul;�and then, for the first time, too late, the thought of
      God will wake up a terrible monitor, whose name is Judge. Mark this, Moor;
      a thousand lives hang upon your beck; and of those thousand every nine
      hundred and ninety-nine have been rendered miserable by you. You wanted
      but the Roman empire to be a Nero, the kingdom of Peru to be a Pizarro.
      Now do you really think that the Almighty will suffer a worm like you to
      play the tyrant in His world and to reverse all his ordinances? Do you
      think the nine hundred and ninety-nine were created only to be destroyed,
      only to serve as puppets in your diabolical game? Think it not! He will
      call you to account for every minute of which you have robbed them, every
      joy that you have poisoned, every perfection that you have intercepted.
      Then, if you can answer Him�then, Moor, I will admit that you have
      won."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,62,"FRANCIS. No more, not another word! Am I to be at the mercy of thy
      drivelling fancies?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,63,"MOSER. Beware! The different destinies of mankind are balanced with
      terrible nicety. The scale of life which sinks here will rise there, and
      that which rises here will sink there. What was here temporary affliction
      will there be eternal triumph; and what here was temporary triumph will
      there be eternal despair."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,64,"FRANCIS (rushing savagely upon him.) May the thunder of heaven strike thee
      dumb, thou lying spirit! I will tear thy venomed tongue out of thy mouth!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,65,"MOSER. Do you so soon feel the weight of truth? Before I have brought
      forward one single word of evidence? Let me first proceed to the proofs�"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,66,"FRANCIS. Silence! To hell with thee and thy proofs! The soul is
      annihilated, I tell thee, and I will not be gainsaid!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,67,"MOSER. That is what the spirits of the bottomless pit are hourly moaning
      for; but heaven denies the boon. Do you hope to escape from the Avenger's
      arm even in the solitary waste of nothingness? If you climb up into
      heaven, he is there! if you make your bed in hell, behold he is there
      also! If you say to the night, ""Hide me!"" and to the darkness, ""Cover me!""
      even the night shall be light about you, and darkness blaze upon your
      damned soul like a noonday sun."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,68,"FRANCIS. But I do not wish to be immortal�let them be so that like;
      I have no desire to hinder them. I will force him to annihilate me; I will
      so provoke his fury that he may utterly destroy me. Tell me which are the
      greatest sins�which excite him to the most terrible wrath?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,69,"MOSER. I know but two. But men do not commit these, nor do men even dream
      of them."
ACT V.,SCENE V.,70,FRANCIS. What are they?
ACT V.,SCENE V.,71,"MOSER (very significantly). Parricide is the name of the one; fratricide
      of the other. Why do you turn so suddenly pale?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,72,"FRANCIS. What, old man? Art thou in league with heaven or with hell? Who
      told thee that?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,73,"MOSER. Woe to him that hath them both upon his soul! It were better for
      that man that he had never been born! But be at peace; you have no longer
      either a father or a brother!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,74,"FRANCIS. Ha! what! Do you know no greater sin? Think again! Death, heaven,
      eternity, damnation, hang upon thy lips. Not one greater?"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,75,"MOSER. No, not one"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,76,FRANCIS (falling back in a chair). Annihilation! annihilation!
ACT V.,SCENE V.,77,"MOSER. Rejoice, then, rejoice! Congratulate yourself! With all your
      abominations you are yet a saint in comparison with a parricide. The curse
      that falls upon you is a love ditty in comparison with the curse that lies
      upon him. Retribution�"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,78,"FRANCIS (starting up). Away with thee! May the graves open and swallow
      thee ten thousand fathoms deep, thou bird of ill omen! Who bade thee come
      here? Away, I tell thee, or I will run thee through and through!"
ACT V.,SCENE V.,79,"MOSER. Can mere ""priestly cant"" excite a philosopher to such a pitch of
frenzy? Why not blow it away with a breath of your lips?
                             (Exit.)

      my devotions?"

   blotted out! Thy doom is sealed�perdition is thy lot! But I
   forgive thee, brother."" Upon this CHARLES embraces and leaves him;
   the ROBBERS however, thrust FRANCIS into the dungeon where he had
   immured his father, laughing in a savage manner. Beyond this the
